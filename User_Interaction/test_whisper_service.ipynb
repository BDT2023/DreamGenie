I just watched it doing its loping thing. It wasn't running, it wasn't walking, it was just doing its brisk lope. It was panting. I was standing there admiring it. Then it went around another corner and was gone. I did not follow it, but I feel like it actually led to something, though I can't remember the rest of the dream.\n"
