Prompt: Give short visual descriptions of the scenes in the following: 
My dream last night started in a cold stark landscape at twilight. I was just standing there.
I like twilight. I was feeling rather calmed by it. Around the corner comes a wolf.
I just watched it doing its loping thing - it wasn't running, it wasn't walking - it was just doing its brisk lope.
It was panting.
I was standing there admiring it. Then it went around another corner and was gone.
I didn't follow it. But I feel like it actually led to something, though I can't remember the rest of the dream.

          Scene 1:
          
Output:  A cold, stark landscape is illuminated by the fading twilight sky. In the distance, a lone figure stands, taking in the stillness of the evening. 
          
          Scene 2: 
           The figure is suddenly interrupted by the sound of loping footsteps. A large wolf appears, slowly making its way around the corner. Its breath is visible in the air as it moves, and the figure admires its gracefulness. 
           
          Scene 3:
           The wolf moves out of view, disappearing around the corner, leaving the figure alone with its thoughts. They feel a sense of curiosity, as if the wolf was leading them somewhere, though they can't remember where.
