My dream last night started in a cold stark landscape at twilight. I was just standing there.
I like twilight. I was feeling rather calmed by it. Around the corner comes a wolf.
I just watched it doing its loping thing - it wasn't running, it wasn't walking - it was just doing its brisk lope. It was panting.
I was standing there admiring it. Then it went around another corner and was gone.
I didn't follow it. But I feel like it actually led to something, though I can't remember the rest of the dream.

I am with the family in a picnic of some sort. There is a snake somewhere visible. I am aware of it, but
not concern. Then comes another one - near, but not near enough to alarm. Saniee goes to kill them.
He has a cane, but so short like a foot or so. A dance starts with Saniee using the cane to hit the snake
and snake is moving around. The second snake is beautiful and each time goes on some pebbles,
there are these radiating rainbow colors like jewels. Next thing the snake is shattered in rock size
pieces, more like a broken statue than a living thing. Throughout, the mood is happiness and joy

I am having lunch with Chris in DC and then I am driving back. As I am driving, I feel that I cannot control the car. Then I realize that Charis and I are sitting in the back seat.

Such a good feeling to be home and see my brother and mom. We went to the street market where they sell rotisserie chicken on Sundays and brought some home for lunch. A kid not related to use was playing around in a car the size of a shoe box and went towards the charcoal where they were barbecuing. Don't know if because of my husband or the dog, my hand felt good tucked in.Output:

My dream setting is in a classroom, like a yoga studio.
The floors are wood, there's lots of mats laying down, the walls are a warm buttery yellow and the lighting is soft.
It looks like a typical yoga studio. I'm on my mat and I'm working something out of my body.
All the postures that I normally do, I'm trying them sideways and upside down and backwards.
I'm amazed that this approach is actually working and it doesn't feel strenuous on my body 
and I wonder why I never thought about doing it this way before.

My dream setting is in a classroom, like a yoga studio.
The floors are wood, there's lots of mats laying down, the walls are a warm buttery yellow and the lighting is soft.
It looks like a typical yoga studio. I'm on my mat and I'm working something out of my body.
All the postures that I normally do, I'm trying them sideways and upside down and backwards.
I'm amazed that this approach is actually working and it doesn't feel strenuous on my body 
and I wonder why I never thought about doing it this way before.

My dream last night started in a cold stark landscape at twilight. I was just standing there.
I like twilight. I was feeling rather calmed by it. Around the corner comes a wolf.
I just watched it doing its loping thing - it wasn't running, it wasn't walking - it was just doing its brisk lope. It was panting.
I was standing there admiring it. Then it went around another corner and was gone.
I didn't follow it. But I feel like it actually led to something, though I can't remember the rest of the dream.

Scene 1: A person stands in a cold stark landscape at twilight.
Scene 2: A wolf starts loping around the person, panting.

I am with the family in a picnic of some sort. There is a snake somewhere visible. I am aware of it, but
not concern. Then comes another one - near, but not near enough to alarm. Saniee goes to kill them.
He has a cane, but so short like a foot or so. A dance starts with Saniee using the cane to hit the snake
and snake is moving around. The second snake is beautiful and each time goes on some pebbles,
there are these radiating rainbow colors like jewels. Next thing the snake is shattered in rock size
pieces, more like a broken statue than a living thing. Throughout, the mood is happiness and joy
