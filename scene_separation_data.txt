I am in my old house, but I am not a child. I am searching for something and I'm afraid that I may get

IN:
My dream setting is in a classroom, like a yoga studio.
The floors are wood, there's lots of mats laying down, the walls are a warm buttery yellow and the lighting is soft.
It looks like a typical yoga studio. I'm on my mat and I'm working something out of my body.
All the postures that I normally do, I'm trying them sideways and upside down and backwards.
I'm amazed that this approach is actually working and it doesn't feel strenuous on my body and I wonder why I never thought about doing it this way before.

Scene 1: View of a yoga studio, the floors are wooden with mats on them, and the walls are butter yellow, illuminated by soft light.

IN:
My dream last night started in a cold stark landscape at twilight. I was just standing there.
I like twilight. I was feeling rather calmed by it. Around the corner comes a wolf.
I just watched it doing its loping thing - it wasn't running, it wasn't walking - it was just doing its brisk lope. It was panting.
I was standing there admiring it. Then it went around another corner and was gone.
I didn't follow it. But I feel like it actually led to something, though I can't remember the rest of the dream.
OUT:
Scene 1: A person stands in a cold stark landscape at twilight.
Scene 2: A loping around the person, panting. The person watches the wolf admiringly.

IN:
I am with the family in a picnic of some sort. There is a snake somewhere visible. I am aware of it, but
not concern. Then comes another one - near, but not near enough to alarm. Saniee goes to kill them.
He has a cane, but so short like a foot or so. A dance starts with Saniee using the cane to hit the snake
and snake is moving around. The second snake is beautiful and each time goes on some pebbles,
there are these radiating rainbow colors like jewels. Next thing the snake is shattered in rock size
pieces, more like a broken statue than a living thing. Throughout, the mood is happiness and joy
