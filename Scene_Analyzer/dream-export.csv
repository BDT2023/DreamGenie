"I had a dream that I ate lunch with Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, that's about it really. We didn't say anything, it was just an awkward silence between the three of us. It was weird."
"I dreamt that I was dating Donald Trump. I guess it was at the point of the dating process where you proceed to sex, cause that is what the Donald was wanting. There was an anxiety building up in me, teetering towards panic as I realized I did absolutely not want to have sex with him but felt pressured to do so. He was coming at me with only a white dress shirt, unbuttoned on. I looked down and saw that he had a small, red, stubby little penis. His hands were little baby hands, reaching for me. I told him that I recently had surgery (which presently is actually true), and that I physically was unable to have sex, presently. He backed down, unable to reasonably pressure me, but I could tell he was frustrated, angry and annoyed about it. Later we were supposed to travel somewhere together, but I somehow was able to arrange that I would be going by myself. I was grappling with how I got myself into this situation, that I was actually dating Trump and how I could possibly tell my brother, without being mortified, cause I knew he would find that idea horrific. As did I. All I was thinking, how can I get out of this?! The thought of having sex with Trump made me sick to my stomach."
"I was sitting at a bus stop in LA with a friend and other ""characters"" Donald Trump walks by and I Start following him he has a nice suit on and actually has regular hair looks like a normal guy.. He starts running away from me, so I run after him. He then swiftly runs into a building only to put on a huge cowboy hat.. I finally catch up to him and I say I need a job. He then stops and replies ""Honest?"" I said yes i'm absolutely honest I need a job. He told me to Email____."
"I was walking down a long line of people, indoors, and inconspicuously there is Donald Trump, in a crowd. I casually approached him, exclaiming his name pulling out my phone. I reach my hand over to his shoulder like I was buddies with him, and capturing a selfie whilst explaining my support for him. The dream ended as soon as I took the surprise Trump photo. This was rather strange to me as this is all coming from someone who doesn't carry any passion for politics."
"I was dating Donald Trump and he was taking me places but he was distracted. Then I remembered... He's running for the presidency! So that's when we go outside and he sees an antelope and pulls out a shotgun and kills it. Upon seeing it...it is beautiful and has many,6 or 7, horns spiraling out. Thats when he begins skinning it and I'm impressed at that point. Midway through he stops and says that ""this animal has been tampered with,"" and he leaves it lying there."
"I had a Dream about Donald Trump it wasn't bad it was actually a good dream. I was in a Black Limousine and as the limo drove down Time square i roll the windows down and i seen lots of people cheering as if there was a big celebration, but i didn't understand why. I look over to the other side of the Limo and there he was saying look at them cheering as he wave at the people.Then i kept staring at him because i was shock to see him in my dream but he kept smiling and saying look at them look at them cheering and then the dream ended."
Dreamed that Trump and someone else was trying to befriend my daughter and I. Trump told us to go to a certain place and they would meet us there. But they never showed up..
"I dreamed that some friends had killed Donald Trump and were eating him. It was really scary. It was a secret that they had done this, but somehow I knew."
"I was outside near the beach, and I noticed that the ocean had rises enormously and I pointed out to people about the huge wave. Everyone ran to fnd safety and I climbed up a tree. When the wave hit the ground it damaged the the land but did not reach or harm the people. Then from the sky, someone was throwing giant golden statues and luxury decorative items. As I took refuge from getting hit by these gigantic items, I ran into a home. Someone had told me in that house that Trump was nearby and was carrying with him gold. I then look around and saw trump sitting down on a sofa. He looked sad and confident and the same time. He look at me with a welcoming look and I took a seat next to him. I then grabbed his hand and hugged him. He was still and quiet and he held on to me as like if he was a scared little boy in need of comfort and safety. Then, I soon felt his tears fall down silently as I craddled him in comfort. Trump was vulnerable but he had to do what he did for a good cause."
"I am a child of Donald Trump. I live with his other children in his large estate. I think we are a mixture of blood relatives, adopted children etc. One day we are all playing in a sterile vacant lot surrounded by chain link fencing. One of the siblings is filming us quietly through the fence. Then at some point we are standing lined up outside the play area and someone comes along, pointing out that we all have on different styles of expensive fur coats. (I note that they are all too big for us.) Then we go home. The house is kind of messed up with our play things and clothing strewn all over the house. Donald comes home and he isn’t mad but is obviously very disappointed in us. One sister sort of apologizes. I feel very bad to have let him down. When he leaves the house to go back to work I want to apologize too. I run out after him to his car to catch him in the driveway before he leaves. (The car seems too small, he fills it up entirely.) I am so sad and I apologize telling him how sorry I am to have disappointed him and I promise to be better. I think I want to touch his cheek. Then I feel so relieved to be in his good graces again."
"I just had this dream this a.m. Very rattling. I often have precog dreams, so this is why I find it disturbing. During the entire Dream, I never SAW Trump, but I knew it was related to him. I was in NYC at a posh hotel. I was in attendance at a conference - business type people with nice suits, most in their 30's and 40's in age. The weird thing about this dream was that a woman 'spirit' voice - a very calm, wise yet gentle voice - was telling me about what was about to happen within the dream. I cannot recall her statements to me, but she was telling me of pending confusion and distress in NYC. I was suddenly aware that all was not right in the dream. People were running around in this building as if there were some kind of emergency & they didn't know what to do. These business people were strangers to me, but they seemed to be people who I was comfortable with - like colleagues, though they weren't. We were in the Trump Tower ( I only visited this building once in my life about 20 years ago). Then, with all of the commotion, we were corralled in this courtyard area of the building and I turned to a small group of people and said, "" This is why I don't trust Trump."" Immediately, I find myself and only a few others in this large commercial elevator with charcoal grey walls of marble. The elevator is falling, falling, falling... It's getting scarier and more pressurized. There are others who seem to be succumbing to the pressure and are falling down and losing their balance; I am strongly bracing myself, but even I am not sure I'll be able to withstand the fast dive. I wake up."
"I was nearby Central Park, Manhattan, when Donald met me near a rather dumpy, abandoned-looking public pool. He started showing me around and describing what had gone on there, and it was kind of depressing, but I was really enjoying his company. We talked extensively about architecture and I was really impressed with the work he had done. Then, towards evening, he left for a few hours and I just sat around the empty pool, fairly contented for some reason. Then, Trump showed up again with a few other people and asked me what I thought should be done. We walked around, and stuff was somehow being fixed. When everything was over, it was a really amazing place - it seemed bigger than before, and very luxurious. Donald smiled, handed me a few hundreds for lunch, and went back up to his tower, which was now apparently right next to the facility we were in."
"I am the observer, watching as I look down and see Donald Trump appear. A loud deep voice-a dream voice with no body attached to it announces this: TRUMP IS FEAR, false evidence appearing real."
"I had a series of dreams about a looming knee surgery, none of which were very pleasant and overall left me with some minor anxiety (at least in the dream state). Towards the end, I dreamed that I was lying in a hospital bed on the parking lot of a local supermarket waiting for surgery. Donald Trump, heavily bandaged from head to foot, lay in another hospital bed next to mine. Even in this state, he harassed and insulted me, pissing me off quite a bit. The scene then changed slightly to me standing in front of an animated billboard of him, to which I gave a brief but succinct antagonistic speech, people around me clapped and I walked away."
For some reason i was sitting on the roof of a car in which trump was having sex and doing drugs with different young and seemingly desperate women. When two women left and trump went out for a break before continuing with a new woman i saw the full extent of the mess inside the car: all kinds of body fluids mixed together in a brown-bloody soup over the car seats and syringes on the floor. I was disgusted but didnt intervene and none seemed to care i was there.
Donald Trump was talking with me about starting a new software company and wanting to hire me. offering a lot of money. But i love my current dream so it wasnt pleasant
today at night i dreamt of trump winning the election for president..and now this...
"I have had 2 dreams about Trump since the election. Tues night I couldn't watch the results so I went to bed just after Ohio went red. I dreamt I was at Trump's Fl resort with 2 other women at a table with Donald opposite of us. He kept asking us over and over, why we hated him. All I could do was cry."
"It was a very short dream that woke me up almost at once. Donald Trump was trying to grab a pussy, but every time he tried his hands came up full of spaghetti. I then realised, with a feeling of horror, that both of us were standing in a lake of spaghetti (the kind with the tomato sauce)."
"I dream that my friend was inviting me to get into a helicopter and inside were two of my friends but in the middle it was Hilary Clinton and in front of us was Donald Trump. I remember I was looking down from inside the helicopter and saw a beautiful place filled with good memories. But then the helicopter landed safely and I was having a conversation with Trump but I saw his hands being goat hands. I was in shock , then I recall , (the devil has one goat hand and one chicken) I wanted to get out of their but I started to fly. Some guys were trying to molest me,then I saw one guy name Salomon. But he was a facebook friend. I'm scared. Salomon told me I was going to be fine, If I just believed in God, So I recall the next place was that I was surrounded by more friends I knew. But this time Hilary Clinton was talking. She told me to call my friend ""Maria"" I saw my actual friend name Maria. Weird. HUH? Well I just remember that I was frightened by the goat hands Trump had. That's why I came here. So at the very end I prayed because that's what I always do to get myself out of a danger. I prayed and prayed until I finally woke up. So here I am. Thank you. Please help. I had stopped having these nightmares. And here they are again :("
I dream that I'm with president elect trump taking photo with him talk about international. Affair I ask him about Palestinian problem and I remember saying to him no president getting close to solve the problem also I remember him talk about deficits and I mention bush also he talk about what I'm doing I told him I'm getting to real estate investing and I remember money in envelop all dream positive
"Last night I had a dream where I was driving this tractor-trailer. Sitting in the cab of the truck with me was Donald Trump. We were hauling heavy equipment. We couldn’t find a place to park the tractor-trailer, so I drove to this lot next to this job site and parked it there. I told Donald Trump that I had parked trucks there before. The owner of the lot walked up to our truck and I asked him if I could park our tractor-trailer there for a short while. He said it would be all right to park it there for a few days."
"I'm riding a turquoise bicycle with a flat tire through steep streets in New York City and my friend saw me from her balcony and said ""come on up I'm meeting Donald""...so I could tell we were all friends. I ditched my bike and Donald pulled up and I said ""hey Donald how's it going what are you here to talk to my friend about"" and he said ""we're meeting to talk about our new salsa company"" and I laughed and said ""that's awesome you can make any company successful."""
"I dreamt I was in the White House as First Lady and he was my husband. Even in my dream I was disgusted by his presence and felt compelled to do everything in my power to keep him from becoming our President. I was a disgruntled spouse who was complaining about everything he was doing. Every time I looked at him I loathed being with him! We were getting ready to go to a show and he kept trying to convince me it was going to be ok? ?Strangely I had the upper hand and he was pretty much agreeing to everything I said and actually trying to be extra nice to me. Very vivid in my mind-Everything was pale pink like the drapes, and layers underneath were whit with hints of old shimmering. Even the furniture was upholstered in sand pink and gold thread, the wood works had gold shimmery accents to it! He wore a black suit, with a white shirt and red tie. I was dressed in a white suit with gold shimmer..."
"I'm on Trump Island. It's supposed to be a big luxury celebrity deal, a kind of trip to fantasy island, but it's just a rough, flat, windswept space surrounded by gray sea with some decrepit buildings on it. People in long overcoats are moving around with no sense of direction, and there's a feeling of something going on, something important but unclear. Trump is in a kind of lounger next to me, and he's really anxious and upset that it isn't going well. He's on the verge of tears. His head looks like it's made of crumbly rubber, with a bad toupee, but I know it's really him. He's started clinging to me, and crying. I'm embarrassed to be there, but I try to comfort him. Later I'm crying out ""Donny! Donny!"" because they're asking me for a ticket I don't have."
I do not typically remember my dreams often but for some reason the following dream stuck with me when I woke up. In my dream I was in the white house with the President and a lot of his staff. He seemed confused and angry and ended up knocking food onto the floor by accident. He attempted to clean it up but kept making it worse and worse. Eventually I offered to help him clean it up. His staff just stood there doing nothing except nodding there heads. That is all I remember of the dream but it was very strange. I felt very confused when I woke up and thought I had probably watched too much TV.
"I dreamt that I was hosting a party/conference for trump , it was a house right by the sea with the water coming right up to the house. I walked in and all the catering and organisation was done for me, which made me feel relaxed ."
"I was walking down an avenue in Midtown Manhattan and I saw Trump walking alone. He didn't have any protection or staff flanking him. He was wearing black sweat pants and a sweat shirt and he looked a bit forlorn. As he passed me I said, ""Good afternoon, Mr. President."" He didn't react. I think someone behind me said hello to him as well. I remember thinking why isn't he wearing his usual suit? In real life, I have seen him in my neighborhood twice before. His daughter lives around the corner from me on 59th and Park and I have seen her frequently over the years since she was a youngster."
"In my dream, I read in a People Magazine that they had an interview with Barbra Streisand and she said something like ""my sister and I have been predicting elections since we were old enough to vote. Unfortunately Trump will win. Sexism is to blame. We know all about men. Many men will not vote for Hillary because she reminds them of their nagging wives, girlfriends or mothers. Also, Trump will do better than expected among men of color. Especially Hispanic men. Mexican and Cuban culture is very macho and very chauvinistic and they don't want a woman in charge."""
"When I thought Trump was placed to help Hillary win, I didn't take him seriously. But then I had a dream he was so kind and spiritual. I've had a few dreams where he even had crystals and would meditate. A separate time I had a dream he said he was going to bring good music back to America and help my career lol! Another time he said he loved his wife so much but she cheated on him. And the most recent...I shook his hand and called him Mr. President and was so happy."
"I was at a pajama party with all my friends, a few strangers, and my boyfriend. I sat next to Donald Trump in the secret sharing circle. After playing with my hair, Donald turns to me and yells: ""EAT YOUR ALMONDS"" and then my boyfriend shielded me and I woke up."
"I was sleeping this morning just before 10:30am I had a dream, President Donald Trump visiting my work place. We seated on the floor on a nicely decorated carpet, pillows, and cushions. I was sitting left to Mr. Trump in a relax mood.He was answering the questions of a group of people. President seems to be a very well groomed gentleman. I was calling him Sir, instead of Mr. President so did everyone. I was trying to ask him a question but everyone was busy asking. But he was ready to listen to me. Then After a while I walked outside while he was still in their."
"2nd dream- Donald Trump was sleeping in my bed. The room was very dark, I walked in to check on him. He awoke and asked if we (my room mates and I) had finished preparing his dinner. He looked a lot older than I remembered him to be, almost sickly and close to death. I proceeded to converse with him about whether I was pleased with his new role as President. I ended up speaking about my younger sister, who is gay. I began crying about her, telling him that he needs to be kind and look after everyone as equals because we are all human and we are good people no matter our religion of sexual orientation. I felt like I had gotten through to him, but as I finished speaking he snickered and shooed me away. Suddenly I was in a large crowd of people, I noticed Donald walking through the crowd towards where I was. I then felt desperate to find my sister, to protect her from him. When I found her, she said Donald had already seen her and that he seemed colder than usual towards her. I then realised it was because he found out she was gay. Donald came back past us a moment later, he said nothing, scowled and walked away."
The dream is short but I had a dream that Donald J. Trump was at a rally for his next presidential election and he was encircled by a larger group of people than in 2016 holding signs and he was talking almost one on one with the people! People were also patting him on the back for the work he had done during his first 4 years!! It was as though I was right there while this was taking place!!
"My father asked me to deliver a package to a business associate of his in another town. I took a Greyhound bus there and went to the office where I was to deliver the package. I waited in a lobby where there were several young people in their 20s waiting. Then all of a sudden The Donald comes out of the office and starts talking to the group, assuming I am with them despite being twice their age. He took us around on some kind of tour. Then at the end I was speaking with him individually and it turned out my father's business associate was Donalds partner that he shared an office with. I gave him the package to give to his partner and it suddenly occurred to me to kiss him so I did. I distinctly remember kissing him, and he kissed me back, and it was not gross. That was the end of the dream."
"I was sailing in high seas with my son (a sweet, gentle kid who is the opposite of Trump) when suddenly he turned into Donald Trump, and suddenly we were pulling the boat ashore. No more sailing. We went into a casual beachfront restaurant and got two seats at a table under an umbrella. Someone brought lunch. I got to choose my side dish but the entree was already chosen. We both had water, but he wanted an alcoholic drink. He couldn't get the waiter's attention. He finally went into the bar and came out with a half gallon carton of chocolate milk. (Bartender's idea of a joke?) He poured one for himself then started going around to the other diners with the milk. He was his ""on stage"" attention-seeking self with them, whereas with me he had been surprisingly pleasant and low-key. When he came back to the table, he was naked. (!!) He sat in a ""manspread"" kind of way so his junk was just hanging out. He seemed to be wearing some sort of weird sparkly thong; I could see a gold chain glittering in his pubic hair. I felt slightly alarmed but more just curious, what did it mean that he was naked? Were we going to have sex? The dream ended."
"Trump was sitting in a golden couch/chair next to Sarah Palin. He was saying ""You should buy these chairs they're only 2 and 3 dollars"". The TV was on. It showed a commercial of the price of the chairs. Sarah Palin was just agreeing with him. Then the dream ended."
"I was at an outdoor rally, but Trump was in the senter of the crowd. His presence there did itritate me, but then he continued to talk. At one point I boiled over with rage so I grabbed Trump in a chokehold and dragged towards the trashcan. It was a rusted, old, metal trashcan. I start to beat Trump with the trashcan, slamming his head against it. He continues to talk during the whole beating, about his childhood, why he's going to ""Make America Great Again,"" and his ""small loan of a million dollars."" He eventually stopped talking with blood dribbling out of his ear. The trashcan was bent out of shape. Then I woke up."
"The only thing i remember is that i saw money and donald trump was on currency,his face was on our money!!! I hope that never happens.....all his plans are ridiculous..."
"I felt that I was in Trump's inner circle. I don't recall seeing anyone familiar or having any political thoughts. I had very little emotion..Not sad, angry or happy or excited. Just present in his home listening and watching him interacting with his advisers and entourage. I think i recall having a conversation with Trump and he seemed curious as to why i was there. the sensation i felt was that he approved of me being in his home with his entourage. There were dogs in my dream... at one point, everyone had left the house but me and i found two dog in a bowl or bucket of water. They were laying one on top the other. i thought they'd drowned, but were alive. at the end of the dream i recall trying to find Trump to let him know that his dogs were alive... I also don't recall seeing anyone familiar except for Trump.. Not any of his family or wife."
"large crowds, Trump's opponent came first people cheer, he appear second more cheers from crowds suddenly some people can from no way trying to push he back."
"I was with my grandmother I saw I brown horse drinking water from a white bucket as we were going around the house outside i saw Donald trump parcking a white bakkie written. Trump in blue caps and he came inside the house. wearing a black trousers white long sleeves shirt orange tie with white stripes .I remember telling my grandmother that the owner of the house is selling because Donald is the real estate agent.and he came out gave my grandmother many silver keys on /in a ring and I said to Him can you please give me a job he said can u be a real estate agent I said if you teach me I can be he said again can u be a real""judge"" in Three days I said if you teach me yes I can be.i asked Him for one of His books he gave me a Blue hardcover and a photo of His daughter when she was a toddler written school of Prophecy I think from his wallet then I asked Him can we take a picture together. he said yes my cousin. took many pictures of us in a garden with white roses and many people started to come around even the media taking the pictures of us together I saw many school kids I asked them do you know who he is they said yes ""He is a billioner"" and were happy like cheering for Him he gave me a hug holding me on my waist like old friends he was happy to be with me and a lady appered and said to Him that tie is too bright for us wear this coat it was black I guess I saw His face being little sad as I went to wake up my brother and cousins to see Him off when I came back we heard a woman saying he has already. left he said he was going to take a train But it had left Him so he went to the airport. to take His plane.I remember feeling sad cause I couldn't see Him off as he was my guest."
"I dreamed that I was running for president. I was in a debate with Donald Trump and a few other nondescript people. President Obama was moderating. A question about the literary and cultural significance of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD came up. Donald Trump started basing Atticus Finch, saying that he was a coward, that he was not a real man, that he was weak. I became enraged and spoke up. Donald Trump interrupted me and called me a ""prom queen."" I tore into his poor literary analysis and called Atticus a national hero. People in the crowd starting cheering and President Obama had to ask them to be quiet."
I had a dream about Donald trump and the woman I was going to potentially date. I was with her at a grocery store but instead of having blonde hair it was black and she was very dark. I get a phone call from Donald and he called to talk to me as if we were friends. I felt as if I were cool because I was talking to him. About two weeks later I found out the woman who I was going to date was actually a satanist pretending to be a Christian. I believe Donald trumps heart is good
"I dream of waking up the morning after Donald Trump has won the presidency. He was making an insane triumphant winning speech. Everyone was paranoid and scared, feeling as if war is imminent. It feels like everything is crumbling apart."
"I cannot recall if the dream took place in a small enclosed building (e.g., classroom) or a large auditorium. I believe I was standing in the back of the building and could see the large group of people attempting to shake Mr. Trump's hand or touch him. I could see Mr. Trump walking left away from wherever he was speaking before turning up an aisle cleared for him to walk through that led toward my direction. Mr. Trump was wearing a Navy blue blazer, red tie and white dress shirt. He had a smile on his face and appeared relaxed. For some reason, I felt one of his sons, which of his two eldest son's I do not recall, was standing with me in the back. I remember this son whisper to me, ""Now you are going to get to meet dad. Don't be nervous."" At that point I felt the son signaling for his father to come to where we were. (Note: I never physically saw his son, just felt his presence and heard him whisper to me that I was going to get to meet his father.) Mr. Trump saw his son, smiled a big grin and walked toward us. I remember feeling extremely nervous. I was actually going to get to meet Mr. Trump -- the Donald Trump. Before I knew it, Mr. Trump was standing right in front of us with Secret Service Agents behind him. At that point, his son introduced us, ""Dad, this is Carlos."" Mr. Trump extended his hand (still smiling), and politely said hello. He was very gracious. Then he asked the question, ""How do you know my son?"" My response, ""Mr. Trump, I know your son ..."" I drew a blank. For the life of me I could not recall the name of his son and which of the two I was referring to ... Eric or Don Jr. Mr. Trump still had hold of my hand and was still smiling as he waited for me to tell him which of his two sons I knew and how we came to know each other. I began to become frustrated because I could not remember. That is when I woke up. Note: Colors in the dreams -- Navy Blue blazer, red tie, white shirt, white or off-white colored walls, red/white/blue American flags, brown folding chairs)."
"Me and an old friend are watching a black and white video where men are sitting rigidly on a flatbed truck in their underwear as it is driven trough a field and hundreds of naked people are throwing tomatoes and paint at them. The entire crowd is almost all white men, though there are a couple women including one very animated woman doing cartwheels. On the truck there is a photo of Trump but he is much younger. My friend and I are confused ""WTF is this?"", we think maybe its from the 90's and has something to do with Ross Perot's failed third party. Later in the dream a hootenanny party I am at morphs into a small fancy dinner in NYC held by Donald Trump, as we are eating and Donald is talking I am making wisecracks which clearly annoys him. At one point he mentions ""being from Manhattan"" and I quip, but aren't you from Queens?"""
"I dreamt that I was in my attic, playing with a new goPro and trying to tell people to walk on the boards so they don't fall in the insulation. Then Trump was in my attic with a small crew. A couple of people gave some soundbites/recordings that might be used. At this point I had spent such a long time shuffling things about in the attic that I was getting confident and swinging on the rafters. Even trump did a small recording in jest. I am not good in front of a camera so I didn't do a recording but I liked being nearby and enjoying the happy, playful time. Then I woke up and realised...'I'd had a Trump dream!"
"Donald Trump wins the presidency. His first day on the job, he calls a press conference. He talks a lot what a great election it was, how he won, won, won and thanked everyone for their support. Then he says, although he is happy he won, he thinks Mike Pence would do a better job so he was resigning. He then announced Paul Ryan would be vice-president. Then he thanked them, wished me them good luck and to do a good job and said he would be watching. Then he walks away smiling and waving. I asked my wife what she thought. She said she had never heard of anyone engaging in wishful thinking while they were dreaming."
"I was at a banquet with many people and tables of food. I was sitting at one of the tables and Trump walks up and sits down. I remember that even in my dream I was thinking, 'what are you doing here?'. He seemed concerned so I said to him, 'It will be okay'. I then got up, grabbed an eclair from the table, and left. That is the dream."
"Well first off I dreamt he was related to me. From what I can remember I was travelling in a car and Donald was aitting behind me , he was anxious and insisted I take a look a letter he received . The letter was some special paper probably made from animal like the royal family use , it had faint pictures of people and death on , the writing was hard to understand but what was clear it was some form of a death threat , Donald wasn't scared he just insisted that I saw this letter . I also remember us being sitting in the lounge talking about his watch , he dipped it into his glass that looked like it had wine in he was telling me about how his watch was water resistant. The watch was gold I believe. That is all I can remember."
"I was standing in the wings of a stage behind curtains. There were those red white and blue round ribbons that you see in American movies decorating the stage along with regular red white blue ribbons. Donald Trump was standing in the middle of an empty stage in front of a singular mic stand with a mic. There was a bright light coming from off the stage where the audience was, maybe a spotlight or a camera light. The audience, if there was one, was dark and you couldn't make out shapes, maybe due to the bright light blinding me or maybe it was a dark empty theatre -- I couldn't tell. There were dozens of tarantulas surrounding Donald Trump and some were trying to crawl up his mic stand. I tried to warn him about them, but he was too haughty to pay attention to me. He just kept on doing his speech, saying things like make America great again."
I dreamt that I was Trump's daughter. He was wearing a grey sweatsuit when he opened the doors to a mansion to greet us. I hugged him because he was upset that he'd lost the election miserably but was trying to play it off. A giant tsunami destroyed the beach and a volcano in the distance was smoking. What's funny is that it's the second trump dream I've had. I had a dream where he was my high school pe teacher and he was yelling insults at all of us and I went to the school counselor begging to be taken out of the class.
"Well, last night I had a dream I was in my tiny home with my 4 kids. I was on my bed with my middle daughter working on a school project. I hear the other 3 kids out in the living room sayin OMG its Donald Trump!!! I didnt even get up I still just finished working on the school project. Donald Trump was then standing at the doorway to my bedroom where me and my daughter we're and was talkin to the kids still in the living room. The kids then asked him if they could please have a dollar to get a drink at the store because there wasnt anything to drink and mommy doesnt have any money and he handed them each a dollar, then looked at me in my room and while writing out a check asked if $24,000 would help me? I was like a frozen statue looking at him in wonder!! I then covered my face and started crying then I woke up! I woke up feeling great though so whatever that dream meant Im glad i had it becuase my day has started of with me being thankful for what we do have and positive abiut what is to come :)"
"I was in the audience at the GOP Convention. I saw Donald Trump up on the stage. Next to him was a very beautiful woman. Then I saw the words ""FIRST KNIGHT."" Then I saw Mr. Trump turn around and place both of his hands on a wall."
"President-elect Trump requested for a hearty, authentic Indian meal. (By the way, I'm not Indian). He drove with my son and I to this remote village... overcoming many challenges, including crossing muddy terrain --finally being able to get freshly prepared food for him. He seemed pleased 
And completely satisfied with the meal that awaited him."
"Had a Dream Donald Trump came to visit me, he was real nice. He ask me how I was and I said I was struggling financially and didn't want to loose my house.I mentioned to him how I had struggled being a single parent in past. I said I'm not saying this for you to give me money. He was dressed in suit and top coat. We had fun and danced. (could be because I mentioned at work I wanted to be at the inauguration on my birthday January 20th)."
"This morning, a few days after the election, I woke at 4 from a dream that had Trump and me in the middle of a prison riot. One of the prisoners was a brutal rapist/murder. I was trying to escape them both"
He was just talking to me and he told me that he will do great things.
"I was in a dark room. Suddenly I saw a red hat on the ground. Not knowing what it was, I picked it up to find Donald Trump's hair inside the hat. I was feeling pretty scared at that point. The scene changed. I was at something that looked like a rally, but it somehow wasn't exactly a rally. Donald Trump stood in front of me then, yelling ""Potato america again."" In the split second before I woke up, I could've sworn I saw a potato watching me, with Donald Trump hair and tan. Then the dream ended."
"I dreampt I was in his house, a really large one. There were threats that he was going to be assassinated all around and I was crying. He was acting like everything was okay and he had alot of security. Everyone was dressed casual, and I think his family was there too. Suddenly the dream shifted and everyone was saying he was dead. I couldn't stop crying, and as I was about to go he stood in front of me and told me I was worried for nothing, he was smiling and totally confident. This part is weird and embarrassing. ...He then proposed to me and put a ring on my finger! I grabbed him and was sobbing into his chest while he was rubbing my back. I have NO idea why I dreampt it lol. That's what prompted me to search if anyone else has dreams of him. :)"
"I was in an old warehouse and was having a phone interview for a job with Starbucks and the HR person on the phone was a crabby lady and seemed to be distracted by something else while she was interviewing me. While the interview was going on, I looked up through a window to another office and Trump was there and listening to what I was saying and nodding when I said something he agreed with. I was frustrated by the interviewer and the process"
"Barack Obama had just given his last speech as President in our living room, as he left, me, my mother and my sister were put into a limousine which took me to a bar called the Orange. It was my prom night, and Donald Trump was there along with Johnny Depp and Ben Stiller to welcome me. As he spoke, I recgonised my father's voice. Turns out Donald Trump was my father! He was quite upset that we allowed Barack Obama to give his speech in our home, loudly announcing that: ""I am President now!"" I remember feeling excitement and anticipation that my father was the biggest meme in the world, and went on to enjoy my night with the friends who had managed to survive fighting as allies in the American civil War that had erupted after Mike Pence was assassinated at a Hamilton Play. ( very topical )"
It was very good dream.Donald hired me to work very closely with him full time and most of what my job consisted of was entertainment. It seemed like many people were flocking around him at something like a resort/? Donald seemed to be so appreciative of my opinion 24/7. It was a very vivid dream and people were a little jealous of me and/or confused about the situation.
"Donald trump was being interviewed by a male reporter, who seemed very aloof. They were both sitting on a bench. The reporter kept looking away as the interview progressed and Trump kept leaning closer to him, as if trying to get him to make eye contact. But the reporter just seemed very timid and aloof. Whereas, I was annoyed and thinking, in the dream, how I'd wish to interview him and would pose, in my opinion, more interesting questions."
"I dreamt that I was in a high school class and donald trump was also attending this class, it was an older version of him and he had alot more wrinkles and his skin was more orange, he seemed like he was disgusted of everyone in that class and started criticizing us and telling us what to do but indeed everyone was blind about it and started praising him and saying the famous sentence: make America great again. AWKWARD"
"Trump was being chased down the street by an angry mob of Americans. He met me in an alleyway with disheveled hair and I gave him a medical kit (like from a video game) to save him. He thanked me humbly and sincerely, out of breath."
"I dreamed I was working with Donald Trump. The atmosphete was comfrontable. The surronding colors around were brown, beige, gold. It felt like I was working for him. He seemed to be a simple down to earth person. Also when he asked me to do something for him I thought he asked very nicely. It seemed the postion he held was some kind of executive officer And. my position was a secretary."
"I am at a public event on the day that Trump becomes inaugurated. I walk up to trump and congratulate him and say ""well done Mr Trump, no no, Mr President!"". Trump asks me to fix his leaking front yard tap. I do so but he becomes suspicious of my work and thinks I am trying to rip him off. As I am walking off his front yard bursts into flames and before long the entire street had caught aflame in a massive gas fire."
"Dream that trump wanted about 14 regular civilians to travel to Japan. The tickets were really expensive $1500+ he gave us option for early bird special rate. That I miss deadline and I still wanted to go. My sister )indentical sister was next to me I only took my backpack and purse on this trip. In order to follow alone with trump flight you had to download app to make you flight purchase. So when I got to the airport A Strange woman drove me on this road that lifted off the ground into a huge parking lot. She drove me through the lot and said hey that where I brought my car look to be dodge neon and she said that my ford. I didn't say anything has we pull into area of glass and office buildings. I could see a man look at us. She immediately waves saying it was her we walk in and go up stairs many levels. It turn into hotel and I rested there for the night and I saw my sister we discuss to get flight seats and room together and was glad I came along. Then it was time to go to our flight I left my crystals under my pillow due to rushing out to catch next gathering. Trump was sitting down looking on his cellphone saying and looking real comfortable with civilian. He said something but his energy give off a good vibe. He stay for good while has people gather into a room with there luggage. He disappears "" I realize I left my purse and crystals and was super anxious I could go on this flight due to me not paying yet. Anycase the woman discuss my flight seat and I ask to if I could be near my sister I made joke so I could share food and movie with her on this flight and I said how much for those lounge seating on the flight she said increase to &500 couple people in the room shook there head in disagreement of price.I have to wait a good amount time to ask them to take me back to the room. The lady pointed to the table and said grab that paper they haven't clean room yet. I said I don't have my key anymore she said no matter. The woman that drove me to building appear. Said to attendance like why give her papers let not do let me just take her instead. We Started to walk me back to room she disappear so I become anxious again started to run got lost in same building I been in all day. It look to become a concern I saw a lady she oh your going toward hospital area. This place was hospital,car dealership,hotel,office building and potential college. Lol. Somehow I got outside and reeally got lost saw myself driving through endless fast food places. I got phone call to get back on the right road and he said Cameron road and there a great marathon you should get into. Then hang up I made back to building. The girl who took me to building appear and took me around and she said business slowing down this huge building may have to close. I said their so much potentional and great college location. She said nothing and walk on to my room. I notice the huge glass and autumn leaves blowing hard but it didn't feel cold outside. When I got back trump was saying something again that seem to be well recieve. I was super anxious I was on the list to Japan without paying trump back. My peers look at me said your excellent at paying people back and don't worry your pay for it just enjoy. I was worry but had all my stuff and we walk to the huge plane. It felt like things was ok place for me but I was like How am I getting this and very anxious of repercussions."
"I was at some sort of religious retreat that for some reason was being held in my childhood home. At the end of the evening, I found myself alone in the room with Trump as we were packing our things and getting ready for the next day. The room was what we used to call the ""play room"" when we were little... toys and tv. I was aware that he was trying to be coy with me, but I thought I could somehow use it to get a word it. I pretended I didn't realize how gross he was so that he would trust me... and then I suggested that protecting women's rights would go along way for his popularity. At that point he took some sort of white-rolled-up-paper-looking tube and said in a weird way, ""you know what this is for, don't you?""... I didn't, but I was creeped out by his tone. All of the sudden I felt something on my leg, and realized he was peeing on me! I was horrified. I tried to scream but couldn't get my voice loud enough and I knew no one would hear me. I ran to the other side of the house and woke my mom and grandma up. I was frantic and trying to explain to them what happened. At the same time as I was trying to explain, I was also wondering how I was going to PROVE what he did, because I was acutely aware that he would deny it and that many people wouldn't believe me."
"There I was with my good friend Eric. We were way up high on some kind of structure and seemed to be boarding a ride or a craft of some kind. Eric was steering the craft at first to show me how to do it. Then it was my turn. I took over the craft and started to bring it down to the ground below. It seemed like some kind of helicopter but very small as it only fit me and Eric side by side. When we landed I jumped off and Eric stayed on taking the craft back up. The moment I turn around I notice that I am now in an all white setting. The walls were white with columns leading to curved arches and they stretched around an enormous square plaza that had what looked like a white woven carpet for a floor. I then noticed that I was being guided around this area by Donald Trump, who seemed to be treating me as an honored guest. He showed me around and introduced me to people. We seemed to be talking candidly but I cannot recall what about. After we left the great white plaza Donald guided me through what seemed to be a naval vessel. We kept going up until we reached a compartment that appeared to be multi-functional. Donald left me at a table with close to a dozen people, all who had communication devices in their ears. They were testing these devices and one of the devices had a distorted sound. Everyone there seemed to know me as they looked to me to figure out what was wrong with the device. I spoke into the microphone and made a few comments and then woke up."
I've been having basically the same dreams about Donald since before he was even president. It's always where I'm like his girlfriend lol. Melania is always super jealous of me and everyone don't get why he chose me. But I'm always super for it! He's always very nice and treats me like a princess. It isn't so real and I can like feel him lol there's so many details I can't even tell them all. It's like it's real life. Always me and him together like in a relationship. Very good dreams
"I was in a car with Mr. Trump, it was a black luxury sedan with only two seats and no roof, he was driving the car, we were heading towards the building of my primary school in my hometown, when we arrived at my school, the building of my school has turned into a big stadium. He was very nice and kind to me, We were having a good conversation, (I can't remember what we were talking about). After some time we said goodbye and he kissed my forehead."
"I was seated, at a table, or maybe a viewing of a show, with my mother and Donald Trump. Donald and I were in conversation, I think he was doing the talking. My mother was not paying attention. Whenever Donald liked my reaction, (or my response maybe) he gave me a golden emblem the size of a belt buckle. The emblem had the eye of province in the center and also had dangling chains. I fastened them to my shirt, which oddly, had empty designs specifically to put these emblems into. I received two, and also received two broken pearl necklaces or bracelets. Most memorable were my random thoughts of killing Donald. There were no secret service members around, and we were in a large crowded room, but no one noticed Donald. As if now was a perfect opportunity to make America great again or something. I do not vote and do not even harm FLIES! These thoughts must have entered my mind just because of the magnitude of someone like Donald Trump sitting with me. I thought of just how many people would act upon this opportunity. When I thought of killing him, he was facing away from me, and slightly diagonal and infront of me. I resisted the urges to attack him. I remember giving the broken pearl strings to my mom, and walking out of the room to find a bathroom. I don't know where I went, all I know is I was walking past cooks and staff, all of which were Asian. One Asian girl stopped me and escorted me somewhere. I'm not sure If I was supposed to be escorted to this next location, or maybe I snuck in, but now I was at a large rectangular table with a wealthy Asian man or maybe two. There was a meeting to be had soon, and there were LARGE amounts of money being handed out and discussed. The money was obtained illegally, somehow, as I listened in to a conversation at the table. I was unnoticed at the table, until I ate a bunch of cookies that were placed on the table infront of each seat. When I began eating the cookies, the Asian man yelled for the girl that escorted me around previously, and told her to escort me somewhere else.......this is all I remember, the dream then took a strange turn to urban or suburban streets where I had powers similar to a super saiyan or something, and I was protecting a very young Asian girl. and was lured to an attack inside a house by some Asian thugs on the streets, and I resisted the attack and turned one of the men into a floatation device and sailed on him/it with another saiyan??? HAHA hey, I'm being truthful here."
we were on a plane and he was my passenger. the pilot was flying way too close to nearby buildings and eventually crashed. we all survived. even trump.
"I was watching a movie in what seemed like an elementary school classroom. It was brightly lit, and someone was handing out fruit leather to us in our desks. When I left the classroom, I found myself in a stairwell as all the doors mechanically snapped shut. I somehow knew that there was a man with a gun in the building, and that I was trapped in that particular flight of stairs. I also knew that Melania Trump was a few flights above me, also locked in. Somehow I sensed that the gunman was Trump, but he didn't know that Melania was trapped in the stairwell along with the rest of us. I should mention that the stairwells were sparsely populated, with only about 3 people locked in each flight of stairs. I woke up before anything more could happen."
"I took a pair of faulty boots back to my local market. The man told me I had to give them to the owner, I looked in the small back room and it was Donald trump sat in a small office. I thought as to how to approach him, should I say Mr trump or Mr president. As I wanted the boots replaced I thought I would go with Mr president, to stroke his ego and assure my boot exchange. I then woke up as I said hello Mr president."
"I wasn't going to share this but here it goes... I was at some political/social event and happened to meet President Trump. He said that he wanted to show me something that was 14.5 inches exactly. He then began pulling down his pants and said, ""See, I told you it's huge."" In reality it (his penis) was not. This is making me want to throw up typing this and I do not know why I had this dream. In reality I would never want to see that! LOL However, I specifically remember seeing the number 14.5, so that could mean something. I don't recall ever seeing anything that connects to the number 14.5 in relation to Trump or in my life."
"Short and simple dream: Trump was running out of the White House in a hurry. (I don't remember much of the rest) but I do remember a round mirror, and he was looking inside it also."
I Dreamt of Donald Trump and the pope. I wasn't part of the dream but an observer. I saw thousands of bloody mangled bodies spread all over. That was trumps side. Then on the pope side I saw just as many bodies but in a very large cradle like metal basket. Clean well-dressed people but still dead. This took place on an aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean. The dream felt like they both kill a lot of people but in different ways. Almost like a contest. Weird right ? I have no idea how that applies to my life. Anyone have any insight?
"I went to a KFC, and then I noticed Donald Trump sitting alone at a table. I sat down with him and we talked about emotional struggles and he paid for all my food."
"In my dream, my 7/8th grade students are to be heading out on a field trip. I am standing in the parking lot waiting for the drivers to file out. Donald Trump has his driver-side door open standing between it and the car gesticulating to the bystanders. I want him to get in the car and drive my students to the destination. However, I cannot bring myself to say the words, ""President Trump"" in order to get his attention and tell him to get in the car and drive it. Instead, I call out, ""The car needs to be moving; we need to get to our destination."" Nothing happens. Trump keeps talking and waving his hands and is standing wedged between the open black car door. I try again. I yell out, ""Get in the car and get it moving; the students need to get to their field trip."" He doesn't stop talking. I turn to someone standing next to me and I ask them, ""Could you walk over to him and tell him he needs to drive the car - I can't get his attention, and I just can't bear to call out the name 'President Trump.'"" I woke up and my dream was so real I am still bothered by it."
"He was coming to an event and he was driving through a body of water. The water would part and people would walk through then a wave would come and then it would part and his limo drove through. We were in a huge colosseum listening to him talk. Then there was an after party and he came up to me wanting my number- I am not a Trump fan and I expressed that. It then turned into a game of him trying to ""win"" me over. My old boyfriend was there, he is a Trump supporter, and Trump told him he wasn't interested in talking. This went on the entire night until I left the party."
"I had a dream that I was dating Donald Trump. I was very embarrassed about it, But i explained it by saying that his parents treated him very poorly and that's why he acted out for attention."
"Trump and I were hanging out on a college dorm floor, just shooting the shit, chatting about life, etc., and I was thinking to myself, ""why does this guy get such a bad rap/put on such a show? He's a really cool dude... and, like, gets it..."" (!!!!!!!!!!)"
"A few nights ago I had a very vivid dream about Trump. I was trying to rent a car. The car rental salesman was Trump. For some reason I thought we were friends, so I said, ""Hey buddy."" Then he replied to me coolly, ""I'm not your buddy, I'm your acquaintance."" He was otherwise very friendly. He gave me the car, and when I lost the car (in the parking lot), he helped me find it."
"I had just found out I was related to Donald Trump, and I was sitting in his mansion's large living room with some of his family. I was being welcomed into the family and he announced that my first gift would be an expensive, lavish trip to the Cayman Islands. I felt awkward about it and said to him that I still won't vote for him, even in light of the trip and him being family. Then I simply left the house and my dream ended."
"I was in an elevator with a bunch of women and Donald Trump came in wearing his black trench coat. I remember feeling so lucky to be in an elevator with Trump. He stood right behind me as the rest of the women surrounded the interior of the elevator. I was facing the door. As we began to go up, the elevator started shaking until it came to a complete stop and suddenly after fell many floors down. You know that feeling in your stomach when you go down a roller coaster? I felt that for several seconds! I remember calling out ""Donald!"" as if to see if he was alright and to see if he needed protection but as I turned around, he was holding I'm not sure how many women, but he was above them with hus arms above their heads as if protecting them from the fall. When I yelled out for him, some of the women started giggling because I didn't even know the man but wanted to protect him. However, he inspired me and I hugged one of the girls next to me and protected her head from any other disaster that we might succumb to while falling in the elevator. When the elevator came to a complete stop after the fall which I'd guess took about 30 seconds, we all came out safely and proceeded to go to another elevator to get to our destination. Many went different ways but I stayed behind Donald. The rest of the dream has faded away, I wish I could remember. Although, I do remember Donald and I not being able to ride the elevator again because they were fixing the whole thing. I remember seeing construction workers working on it."
"was working for Trump and I went to his house and it looked beautiful on the outside but when I got in the house, deep in the house in other rooms there was chaos and stuff everywhere. He had me watching his ""grandkids"" who wouldn't listen. We were trying to make cookies. I also had a dream about him again last night but don't remember that one."
"I was driving from Brooklyn to NJ with my parents. There were massive protests going on. We had to stop at the Police Precinct before crossing into NJ. It was full of protestors - Muslim girls and gay boys. People were hanging off the rafters. There was also some kind of police Ball going on, where they were dancing. Suddenly it was announced that Trump was coming. I took a position with the Press, so I Could film or take pictures of him with all the Muslim girls protesting in the back. He walked in and knew my name. I pretended to smack him across the face. Then I said I was kidding. Everyone thought he deserved it, including himself."
"This may kind of bizarre but I dreamt that Donald Trump sent a Darlek to try to kill my family, especially the children under 10. He did not come to the UK as he sent the Darlek from America. In my dream he was president. I felt worried more for my family than myself, I did not know where the Location was but I assumed it was in the UK. In the end the darlek killed my 5 year old cousin."
A baby is in a laundry basket. I'm told to take care of him but I tip the basket and he disappears. I feel awful. Later in life (in my dream) I find the baby was just sent away to be raised out west. For some reason I am Donald Trump's sidekick. I go on a road trip to find the young man who was previously the baby. I meet Trump in a parking lot. Trump puts on a silicone mask to disguise himself but he's like 8.5 feet tall. He goes up to a guy with the mask on to ask if he looks like whoever the mask is. We go inside a building and talk to the kid who used to be the baby. He's smart and well adjusted. Turned out ok. Trump as usual is full of BS.
"I had apocalyptic dream about the end of the world and zombies - and Donald Trump was in it. I was playing a card game in the hallway of Stuyvesant Highschool, a famous NYC school which I never attended, and I was playing with Idris Elba and The Donald. While we were playing someone asked Donald why he bleached his hair when everyone knew he had natural brown hair. He immediately lost it started yelling and pointing and then left. After his departure, the hallway lights began to flicker like crazy and that's when everyone in the dream realized the zombies were coming. We all started running and that's when I woke up."
I was in a plane with donald trump and a window opened it sucked his hair off his hands and his head he dies it felt so real
"All I remember is that I was standing on the corner of a street dancing around and people were admiring my dancing skills. Then I got inside the world's smallest airplane and revealed my true identity as a woman to some other woman on the plane, and we had lesbian sex."
"In my dream, Barron Trump came up to me and said ""Would you like to meet Donald Trump?"" I looked puzzled. His hand was pointed behind me so I turned around and saw Donald Trump walking towards me. We were outside maybe at an empty outlet. Donald Trump came up to me and shaked my hand. I don't remember what happened next, but all I know is it replayed in my dream again except in a different setting"
"In the dream I discover that train tracks that have recently been laid through the middle of my small apartment. Then along comes a train and Donald Trump is on board. Uniformed jackboot guards escort me aboard the Trump train and inform me that Trump says I can no longer stay at my apartment, because it is now Donald Trump's train station. Trump sees that I have a ticket to ride the train with him in his personal car. Together we go down a winding path to his palatial mansion, where we disembark. Trump then leads me to the vast expanse of green rolling hills that comprise his back yard. With a flourish, Trump produces, from inside his cluttered garage, a live goat on a rope. Trump presents me with the goat, hands me the rope, and then bids me farewell."
"I had a dream that instead of Hillary Clinton, I was the democratic nominee for president. For some reason, Vladimir Putin told me to come to Russia to get my picture taken because I looked like Harry Potter and he was apparently Putin’s childhood hero. After taking the picture, I came back, and it was the day before the election. For some reason I was sleeping in the same room as Donald Trump. He aggressively walked up to me and asked if I wanted to have a final presidential debate there in the bedroom. I said that I just wanted to go to sleep. So we both went to bed, me sleeping on a matress on the floor. I had to get up to use the bathroom, and we apparently didn’t have a bathroom, so I went outside to pee on a bush. I was troubled by the fact that some of my pee was red, and while I was peeing a guy from my high school randomly walked up to me and said hi."
"I was helping out backstage at a big event, then realised the big event was the presidential election. I spoke to Trump backstage and he just handed me his coat, looking shocked and worried. then went out on stage.I felt like something bad/urgent/chaotic was going on, but I didn't know what."
"Mrs Stewart called to ask for a babysitter but we were in India. Got into London and was looking over London from Gherkin. Donald Trump was there and he was saying he couldn't wait to have his second country, ie the uk,. He was related to Mrs Stewart and so I got to talk to him and asked was it ok that I couldn't babysit for Mrs Stewart - he said it was fine. We went to his carpet mansion. I dropped a horrible spider on my sister Pippa and she blamed Johnny, my younger brother. The spider was red, stripey and had huge teeth with googly eyes. Mum got Pippa in trouble for calling Johnny 'fat rat boy'."
"As much as it makes me feel disgusting, I had a dream, or should I say, nightmare about Donald Trump. In this nightmare I was on top of him having sex with him. Which was rather repulsive. I can't work out what this dream means...."
"I had a dream that Donald Trump sent a paper to everyone with a list of demands about how they should behave. Later, my girlfriend and I were in a parking garage where a bunch of illegal immigrants were hiding their children in their cars so that they wouldn't get deported, until Trump walked up to them threateningly and started digging through their cars to find the kids. At the very end, Trump suddenly thought that my girlfriend was a witch, which violated one of this decrees he had made earlier, and the two of us and him had an insane duel"
"I’m getting married! I am preparing for my upcoming wedding. My fiance, Donald Trump, has given me a necklace to wear for our wedding. The necklace has a large oval moonstone set into a square platinum setting surrounded by diamonds, on a small link platinum chain. I am not sure I want to wear this necklace. I have another necklace given to me by my last partner, John. It is a gorgeous platinum necklace set with baguette (rectangular shape) emeralds, and diamond pave (tiny diamonds). It is a series of ¼” links and has an elaborate clasp as a focal point; it’s more dimensional with the same design. While deciding which necklace I will wear my ex-husband, Peter shows up. We go to the local nursery with a container with two plants in it; we own together. One of the plants has died. The man at the nursery says the problem is the two plants need different environments – one needs sun and lots of water, the other less water, and no bright sunlight."
"I’m in a bathtub with Donald Trump. He tells me to wash my hair. Melania sits on the toilet with the cover down and tries to make nice. He’s not being sexual with me. Maybe I’m not attractive enough for him to notice. I tell Melania he’s my father. I know no good will come of this. I note that he is circumcised because I know people will ask. Why won’t he let me take a shower? I need to rinse my hair. There’s not much water. Should I pull the white shower curtain? I decide not to. It’s no use. He cannot win, I think to myself, trying to make it so."
"I had a dream with Mr. Donald Trump, that i am one of his secretary. And i just love what i look like on that dream, it's like i am a different person, very fashionable. And we are walking inside the mall. We went inside the store. And after that, i don't remember anymore."
Dreamt that I was someplace in a fancy building which felt like the lobby of a hotel. I was with several people and Trump was there too with everyone talking. Several of us sat down and I sat down next to Trump on a couch where we struck up a very nice conversation. We than hugged each other heads side to side as he continued to talk to me. And then we both sat in our original positions still talking. Our conversation went on for a very long time and we were still talking to each other when the dream ended.

Children was goofing around and had a good time, just like we had. Trumps white skit was half open and I had my hand on his chest. He had orange chest hair. He smiled at me and I felt so happy. After a while, we got up to countine the day. We went to a pancake party but it started to Rain and the pancake got wet. Then I was in side the house, hiding and sneaking around, from what idk. The end"

"I see Donald trump setting onthe floor with my parents and i told him, congratulations mr trump. I had a nightmare in the same dream but in different position."
"I am a Muslim, and I don't remember much from the dream. I saw that I am the Vice-President of USA and I wanted to take leave from the job and I go to Trump to ask him for leaves but Trump himself says that he was going on holiday."
"I was looking at the directory in the mall and saw a couple of my close family friends. Spencer was with a bunch of his guy friends and said they were going to see The Apprentice Live so I said sure why not I would join. I just wanted to hang out with my friends, not cause any trouble. Just hanging out and having fun. A large group of us started walking to the show, which you had to go up lots of weird stairways and outside then inside and weird forks in order to get to the studio, which was more of an arena with a large large green field in the middle and lots of bleachers for people sit on in the audience, which was very very dark. I was walking with Spencer, my little sister Meriele, a couple other friends, some people from high school and my college I think, but generally I was surrounded by lots of white middle class douchey teenage boys. There were crazy crowds heading to the arena, so you had to try to stay with your friends and could barely see your own feet. Once we got to the arena there was plenty of space for all the people since the arena was so large, and I ended up sitting with some of my friends, I think Spencer was there but mostly miscellaneous college people, and were in about the second row down to one end of the arena. We kept moving around and didn't really settle until Donald Trump came out and the show started. When he entered everyone cheered, except me. I was booing him. In a simultaneously joking and serious way. I was still there to have fun - but I was not going to put up with the glorification of a monster or any other BS he would throw our way. People realized I was booing and started shouting things like ""oh, she'll be sorry"" (most of the yelling at me was in the voice of one of my friends from the college I transferred from, a pro-trump and highly aggressive boy) and ""he's going to get her!!"" Thrown in with a couple incredibly rude and sexist remarks. I shrugged it off, Donald was so far away in the middle of the arena that there was no way he would hear me. However, I began to get weird looks and vibes from everyone in the audience after the booing incident (I didn't see any of my friends anymore, it was all strange white boys). Then he started talking, I don't remember what he was saying but I was just chuckling to myself at how stupid it all was. Then he saw me. He came all the way over to my side of the arena, opened a gate (like the way you would get into a skating rink) and told me to ""come with him"". The arena was silent. I was shaking from fear, and after a couple seconds calmly and matter-of-factly responded with ""I would prefer if you would inform me of where you are taking me before I follow you."" He kinda looked at me for a little while, judging me and surprised by my resistance, until he continued to ask me to follow him, and I was silent or politely refused, until he said ""suit yourself."" And he left to continue with the show, while of course poking some fun at me. After he left, people stared to chatter and a couple people were exclaiming things like ""why doesn't she want to be the judge?!"" In my pro-Trump “friend”’s voice. Apparently that's where they thought Donald was taking me, to be the judge on the show, but I've never seen The Apprentice so I don't know if that's an actual thing. Then the audience began to heckle me a little behind my back, and I couldn't make out strongly what they were saying. But after Donald left I noticed that my phone, wallet, and ID were all missing. I didn't notice this until after I ran out of the arena because I wanted nothing to do with this ridiculous show anymore (I had tried to sit through a little more despite the hecklers, didn't want to give them satisfaction). After running through the hallways, and I ran into a couple young family friends while I was traveling back to the lobby, I reached the dark and large lobby covered in hideous red velvet. There I saw my friend Spencer’s mom, sitting by the directory for the mall that we were still in. I went to say hi and explain to her what just happened, and that my stuff was missing. I then ran in and out of the arena to try to find my belongings to no avail. On the last time I went in I found my little sister Meriele and a couple of my other friends, Hannah and Lauren, who had also gone to the show but I didn't see once I entered the arena the first time. Meriele hugged me and said she was proud of me (I was just worried my little sister was still in the arena, what if Donald knew she was my sister and tried to do something to her? She's a BA but still very young and wouldn't know to hold her own). I told them we should get the hell out of here, so they grabbed their bags from this shelf at the end of the bleachers, and we walked out. I didn't find my phone or money. When we were back in the lobby I realized I could use find my iPhone to find it, since my normal phone (6S) had been having issues I also had my back up phone (5C) on me that day and that one hadn't been stolen. 

When I checked find my iPhone, it said that my phone was 10 miles east of us in another city (in California, because apparently that's where my dream took place), and had a sludgy black icon by it indicating that it had been destroyed. I was so confused. How has my phone been taken from me? How did it get somewhere else so fast? Why was in destroyed? What is this new government doing, trying to silence everyone who doesn't go along with them (despite the constitutional right to freedom of speech)? Had they wanted to keep me from sharing my experience over social media? Luckily I had my back up phone still to use. 

And after I checked Find my iPhone, I woke up. Very confused and startled by this dream, as I rarely remember my dreams and they almost never make this much sense."
"I was at a rally or party. I saw Donald Trump come down in the elevator. He was upset because his son had died. He came in and talked with the people in the crowed and patted them on the back. Then, I think he gave a speech. After the speech he laid back into the crowd and crowd surfed. When he came by my mom and I, we weren't strong enough to hold him up. I tried to set him down gently so he didn't get hurt in the fall. Then as he left he turned and pointed at me and jokingly said ""I'm going to get you"" meaning that he was going to surprise me with something fun."
"I was supposed to be at a formal presentation but, I was dressed in shorts and a tank top. I was standing in front of a beautiful building but, was anxious about going in due to my attire. As I stood there, President Trump comes over like we've known each other forever, takes my hand ever so gently and he sort of waves his individual fingers against mine. He then looked right at me and said ""Don't worry about how you are dressed, you have the same right to be here as everyone else."" That's it. It made me feel good. Accepted."
"My dream started on inside of a Walmart where I kept finding money on the ground. I was walking with my father and kept delaying our shopping trip to return the money I found every few steps. He told me to just keep it after a while but I kept going to the money center to return it to the lady working there. After finally finishing shopping, we walked outside, where it was very dark, on a grey sidewalk. We stopped at a bus stop. He turned around and asked me how my sister was doing. I turned around and she was dead, her whole body crammed in a magicians hat. I started screaming and ran into Walmart. To call the police. I went inside and nobody believed my story or would let me use their phone- except finally the lady at the money center because I had been so honest before with returning the money. I got to ""9-1"" and couldn't dial the last digit to call the police. After minutes of not being able to press the last 1, I finally did and called the police. I returned the phone and went outside to wait back at the bus stop, a few yards away from the Walmart. Then I waited and instead of the police, Trump came. He started to talk to me but then said something like ""no this place just won't do"" and he pulled out his phone and said something I didn't hear. Before I knew it, his workers built a two-story house right beside Walmart for us to chat in. As we walked in, I began to protest that I wanted to wait for the police but Trump convinced me to listen to what he had to say. I sat down at a circular table with Trump and he pulled out an easel with a pad of paper. He began to talk to me about a serial murderer who killed one member, and then an entire family. He mentioned that he thought THIS was what happened to my sister. Frightened, I asked him how he knew so much about this killer and how could we stop him. Trump said it was actually his brother when we heard a knock on the door. The police entered and Trump began telling them this same story, and then began sketching what his brother looked like (the police totally agreed with him). Now I should mention that there were no lights in this house except the street ones through the windows, since it was dark outside. Then we heard a rustle at the back door and the police ran. Trump and I made eyecontact and he nodded, as if to say ""Yes that's my brother and he's here to kill you"" and Trump and I both started sprinting away when I woke up."
"I have had many dreams about Trump since his election, most of them since his inauguration. They are always bad dreams/nightmares and I wake up very distressed. The most recent fream was last night. My dream concerned some sort of environmental disaster that I, and others, were first trying to prevent. We failed and we were trying to flee to safety. This dream was in a jungle setting--some sort of science lab. I knew some of the people, not others. The last I recall, I had stowed away on one of the scientist's boats and we were going down a river. My being on the small boat was making it too heavy and the boat was having trouble navigating."
I dreamt I was married to Donald Trump and he wore pajamas that look like his regular clothes and his penis was a baby carrot. He also sent me to Victoria's Secret to buy my inauguration dress with a black American Express card that said president of the United States of America. I told him Victoria secret didn't carry plus size clothes and he said they do now. I went to Victoria's Secret and they do not carry plus size clothes and they said they would get them I had my own American Express card that said Mrs. president of the United States of America and paid for peoples dinner at the mall where the Victoria's Secret's was with my black American Express card. I also dreamt of the inauguration in the White House inside was kind of tacky and dirty. The funniest part was Barbara Bush was sleeping in a cot in the hallway and blue pajamas with her pearls on her neck. And as I walk down the hallway all the other first ladies are sleeping on cots in the hallway
"I dreamed that Donald Trump gatecrashed my Muslim female friend's baby party in Dubai. For some reason not only were Donald's hands small, he was proportionately tiny - shorter than me (I'm 5'5"") and looked petite next to Melania. While he steamed around the room talking loudly about something no one could understand, Melania offered everyone lemon slices baked by Ivanka. The cake was pretty good."
"I dreamed I was stuck in an elevator during the day going upstairs in an office building. Suddenly, Donald Trump and several other middle-aged men entered the elevator and forced a teenage girl to strip down to her panties. Trump and the other men viciously gang-raped this young girl right in front of me, but I felt powerless to stop them, let alone to report them to the authorities. I feared they would exact revenge against me like the Italian Mafia or Japanese Yakuza."
"Some people and I were kidnapped by Trumps people. They took us to some kind of rally or something. Somehow I ended up in the back room with the Donald and I was going to distract him so the others could get away. I started performing fellatio on him and his manhood was small at first but grew to normal size but it had little tiny spikes all on it kind of like a cats thing(or so I've heard it described). I had my breasts in his face and then he told me he was ready ( which is very considerate ) and I then gave him a hand job till completion. The strangest thing aside from his spikey penis, was I went from disliking Trunp and being upset we were kidnapped to liking him and wanting to vote for him:-/"
I dreamt that there was a flying car. Coming down I was super scared and confused because normally its planes not cars it was super windy like today's weather in my dream the car was out of control and it landed on the street of my house almost hitting a car from my neighbor when I ran to see if the person was okay it was Donald trump in the car smiling/laughing and just a creepy look and he left quickly. I knew that after seeing him he was purposely driving like that his face and the way he looked at me made me feel really scared
I had a dream Donald Trump interviewed me for a job
"I was his secretary or something and was in his office and in his lap and we started making out and I was kissing his neck and he was kissing mine and I never gasped so sharply in a dream and we were getting undressed until finally I was in my bra and tights and I was all ready and then he was like we can't do this, your barley dressed! And I was like yeah, isn't that the whole point? And he was like, no go put on a decent night gown right now! And his wife was there and I was just really confused. I think this dream came from memory's of reading the Donald Trump Fan fiction my friend told me about"
Donald trump is my boyfriend. Donald Trump is running for president. He is waiting to hear whether a sponsor has agreed to endorse him. He is waiting by the phone. Then he goes outside. The cell phone rings but I don't know which button to push to answer it. He comes in the house. It turns out to be a woman who is calling. He makes a date with her even when I am standing there and he has his arm around me. He decides to go to the convention even though he hasn't heard whether the sponsor has agreed to endorse him. It is getting close to the time of the convention. It starts in a few minute. He Is all dressed up and what I notice most is that he is wearing bright green shiny shoes. I see them close up like I am sitting on the ground. He finds out the sponsors not going to sponsor him. He can't run for president. I try to comfort him. He doesn't go to the convention. I am playing with the dog that seems to be a pitbull. She is very sweet and loves to play. GR is also in the dream. I am at his house. I have not told anyone that I'm not voting for Donald Trump. I'm a Democrat even though he is my boyfriend.
"I dreamed that I was in the hall where the RNC is being held; I was wearing a short Pocohontas type dress; Trump was pontificating on the big screen and I was searching everywhere for a bathroom because I had started to menstruate (hah! I am 70 years old!-but I was younger in the dream) -- blood was running down my legs and I finally found the bathroom. All the toilets were overflowing with excrement and toilet paper. Suddenly Trump bursts through the bathroom doors (he has been searching for me) and I start to run but the floors are slippery with my blood and I fall and scramble up again and fall...people are cheering in the auditorium and all was chaos...then thank god I woke up. (Apparently I thrashed around some cuz when I got up and looked in the mirror my hair was mashed like a Trump combover. ; )

"
"I was the passenger in a big car with Trump driving, maybe an old Lincoln. A lady was in the back seat not sure who. We were comfortably talking. As we traveled, I felt a sexual desire for Trump that surprised me. I don't like Trump. But in the dream he was a nice guy. He parked the car in an underground garage. I asked him if he needed protection and he said no. He sat on a curb in the garage and a few passersby recognized him and started talking with him. He was smiling and very regular. I was quite stunned at how likable he was."
"I went to walmart. My stomach was hurting because i ate a lot of sugary foods, so i went to get pills to help my ache. (diabetes pills) (is that even a thing?!) i dont even have diabetes! Anyways Donald Trump owned the grocery story i went to and i saw him walking out as i was walking in. After i purchased the pills i asked the cashier to get a hold of Trump so i could talk to him. i asked trump if it would be a good idea to consume the pills because of my stomache ache and i told him that i didnt have diabetes, he said i shouldnt take the pills and i said yeah youre probably right, ill just resell them (?!!??) then we went to my friends house and everyone was hanging out downstairs but me and him were upstairs only because i wanted to know what his plans were for presidency if he were elected and what he would try to make legal or illegal. (also his appearance was very casual he was wearing jeans and a blue tshirt and his hair was very long and in a pony tail) i dont understand this dream and i dont think anyone could possibly explain it."
"I am in a movie theatre and my mother is in the balcony. I tell her to use the remote to turn on the movie I want It is a horror movie I have seen before and when the movie begins I am in the movie as the man character, a man. There movie is about a slumbering monster You don't know where it will appear It will come from under the street or in a wall or from under a house. Realizing that this is an old movie I struggle to tell the others what will happen in the future. ""There's going to be an election! You'll never guess who's running against Hillary Clinton! It's another woman! Then I think no, that's not right! Why can't I remember who she's running against? All along the monster is looming and when i see it I think the stagecraft is cheap Does it look like plastic? It's like a rock growing out of a wall of a building in a city."
"I dreamed that there was something wrong with his taxes but that doesn't put effect on people,they still want him to become president. The other part of my dream he help make poor homes into rich homes ,by that I mean homes that are falling apart and are damaged,he restores them."
"I'm looking at a glossy magazine like People or Us Weekly, and the headline on front reads something like ""Hillary Camp Disputes Her Health Rumors. Trump Hospitalized"", meanwhile people around me are discussing whether ""Trump's new song"" is better than Aretha Franklin's ""Spanish Harlem"", it appears to be some kind of radio contest or listener poll."
He came in i dropped my phone and earbuds and hugged and they took a photo of us
"In my dream, I was in bed at home at night feeling comfortable. In the dream, I was woken from my sleep by a figure wrapped in a dark sheet who came into my room. I thought it was my sister. The figure got into bed with me, to my left. I couldn't get back to sleep, because I felt very distracted by this person. I got annoyed and told the person to move to the other side - my right side. The figure moved, but then got too close to me. I realized how disgusting it smelled. It then got on top of me and tried to kiss me. I realized it wasn't my sister, but a dark shadowy male figure. I couldn't make out his face. I tried to scream in the dream, but words wouldn't come out of my mouth. I was paralyzed with fear. I was able to say, ""Get away from me."" I woke actually moaning in real life, ""Get away from me"" over and over. And as soon as I woke, feeling panicked, I knew the entity had been a combination of Trump and the figure of Death."
"In the work truck trump sat between me and my employee saying he needed ride home. He wore a starched , bright white shirt and tie. He said he was going home to drink. He said he has a drink every day. He had on very expensive sun glasses. They were blue with lights and buttons. He asked if I wanted to try them on. I did but didn't think they were very good"
"I have dreamed this same reoccurring dream four times in three months. I am standing in a church looking up at the Michealangelo painting, The creation of Adam... But instead of (Adam) I see God is reaching down to Trump. They are not touching though. I see trump with a Black suit on with a white shirt and a silky black tie. He has a scared look on his face like he is about to flinch. That was the first two dreams.. Then the next two are exactly the same as those expcept after I had those...I dreamed of standing in front of Trump towers and looking up to it and seeing it (INTACT) but hearing ""Trump towers are no more""..."
"I was at a Donald Trump rally and I believe it was in my grandmother's backgarden in England. It was a big crowd, Donald was getting cheered and they kept asking me to stand up and I replied ""I cannot because I'm from England and I might wake up"" They relented I think. I asked Donald ""What do you think of Clinton's anti-Catholicism?"" before waking up."
"Donald Trump was in my bed, totally none sexual, bit for some reason we were sharing a bed together for sleeping. He seemed nice and even helped me with some spelling on a paper while sitting in bed. Then we went to sleep, I got the feeling this was for more than a night or two. I woke up disturbed as to why I would be in bed at all the Donald, I detest him a lot. Made me wonder if this was some kind of a sign that he was going to be president and that basically meant that the entire nation was in bed with him?"
"I was in my hometown and trump, hillary and michelle obama were there. I was walking towards trump and michelle obama was walking about 2 metres infront of me towards him aswell. I was worried they would start talking and make me the awkward third wheel but michelle turned slightly so she would then walk past trump and trump was surprised aswell so he just pointed and smiled at her to make it less awkward. I then got to trump, we shook hands. He was amazing. Then I said i better go shake hillaries hand incase anyone i know sees me only doing it to you if you don't mind lol. i then shaked hillaries hand and started to notice the lack of security in the place. People were walking into the field from all angles with no security, i mainly noticed people walking in behind trumps side of thhe field basically had his back open to a wide area."
"It was only there for a few seconds, but it was a very good dream that I much enjoyed. I was shaking God Emperor Trump's hand, and we exchanged some kind words, however I can no longer remember what those words were. All in all, I enjoyed the dream :D"
"I was in a swamped crowed of people sitting in anticipation at a stadium for the results to be drawn, the curtains drew. Donald Trump won. For some reason everyone in the crowd was overly excited and jumping in fits of joy over his victory."
"Donald kept following me everywhere I go, he was so annoying. We were at a shopping mall with other people. And he only seems to want me"
"I was in a car, one with black leather material. The car has three rows of seats and Donald Trump and my brother resided in the middle set and I sat in the back row. I sat behind Trump and he reclined is chair to touch my knees. I have him a dirty look and received the same back but he soon put his chair back. Then, not immediately after, almost like some time had past, Trump asked me to get something from the seat next to me that was him and he reclined his chair and I gave his item to him and the very slightest bit of our fingers brushed past eachother and I was disgusted so much that I quivered. My brother gave me a dirty look and Trump put his seat back on. I realized that I could mess with Trump if I wanted to and texted my friend and asked ""Should I shout I'M GAY!"" And my dream ended at that."
"I am on a date with Donald Trump. We are eating lunch in a restaurant on a film set. We are at the film set because Trump has been picked to be the new James Bond. During the meal, Trump begins to choke, and I think he is having a heart attack. I shout out ""Is there a Doctor in the house?"" but the other diners ignore me. Then I shout ""At least bring him a glass of water!"" but the other diners avert their eyes. (It occurs to me now that I think there was a carafe of water on our table, but I didn't pour him any.)"
I am a trump supporter.. maybe more didnt want the alternative the night before the election he came to me in a dream and kissed me on the lips...his lips were very soft. i felt very close to him. I'm not overtly attracted to him in a sexual way
The dream was more like a vision. I believe that my eyes were open and that it happened in a matter of seconds. I saw a plush field of grass and it was nighttime. Trump sprinkled something like fairy dust on a small portion of it and the grass grew just in that corner of the field. Then Trump rode out off on a bicycle and wasn't seen again.
"I was in the Oval Office with him, he was polite and we were talking about how America is safe from currupt democarats, his administration is very well the best I seen. He was saying how the constitution and traditions will long live and will not fall, he then told me to defend my country with pride: I'm joining the marines and leaving to boot camp soon."
We were in an exslusive mall somewhere and we just kept kissing eachother over and over again constant kissing
I was teaching him how to behave when he farted. Then I spoke to him in Spanish and he answered back in perfect Spanish. He promised to behave in the future.
"Donald Trump is here. My impression is that I am at IGAD. This may not be true, but that was my impression. For most of the dream, I was with Donald J. trump (Trump). He didn't say much, but seemed to walk with me wherever I went, though it could be I was following him around. There was some kind of a ball planned for a little later, for which many photos had been printed on sheets of paper about two meters wide. I was annoyed with myself for not doing this with one of my photos, because mine could have been chosen as the image used to promote the event. Trump says something like""come with me"", which I took to be an invitation to eat lunch with him. It felt like something we'd done before, but it only happened once in the dream. I walk with Trump, but as we walk, I run into a student who wants some feedback from me. He shows an animation of some cubes and cylinders tumbling down a hill, but it looks like he hand animated them instead of using a dynamics program. This lowered the quality of the result and also got in the way of finishing the project, which he hadn't done. (Due to problems with my dream journal program, I sent this as email to myself and am finishing the dream record as an email which I will forward to myself) While sitting with the student, I say that his project should be complex enough to be a legitimate challenge to himself. His project had many objects in it that could be described as complex because they were numerous, but the problem they represented was simple, so the project was not a legitimate challenge. As I said this, I noticed Trump nodding his head seriously as if in agreement. We then left the student and kept walking. When we came to a metal staircase, it occurred to me that the school year was almost over (it is currently exactly half over). My impression was that in a month or so, it would be summer. I say something on this subject, namely, that in the years before Trump arrived (the current year) the years went by much more slowly. When we get to street level, a limo comes for Trump. He gets in and I follow. As we drive, someone calls him on the phone. He says ""okay, you've got fifteen seconds and then I have to let you go"". This was the amount of time before we got to our destination. When we get out, I decide to tell Trump that I like the title of his book ""The art of the deal"". I explain that I enjoyed nothing more than making deals when I was a kid, then proceeded to explain how I made my comic book collection back in the 1970's. While I am talking about this I wake."
"Donald Trump was my Flatmate, which in my dream was more of a background information, because the dream setting was some private party of his somewhere else. Everything was super luxurious, sunny, nice snacks, and he was really nice to me, showing me around and being attentive. In my dream I knew that I actually am against Donald Trump, but for some reason meeting him in person I actually liked him. I was wondering if he had manipulative superpowers of some sort, because it didn't make any sense that I got along with him so well. I met his family, all were very nice too. I kept my resentments against them hidden and took part in conversations. I had the feeling I saw the human sides in them, everyone thinking they are actually doing the right thing, being good people, but getting it all wrong because they live in this super rich bubble, disconnected from the real world. Later more people joined the party, even an old friend of mine. We got a bit drunk and at one point I told him that Trump is actually sharing a flat with me at the moment and we both laughed at the absurdity of it."
"I was married to Trump and we were at some kind of social gathering. I was sitting next to an old school friend, talking to her, when I heard a verbal attack outside and saw that a group of African people were fighting with Trump. They appeared to be insulted by what he was saying and then they left and Trump came back inside. He sat down next to me and I asked him whether it had been taken out of context or had he said something insulting? He answered that it had been insulting but that he didn't care. I was mortified that I could be married to someone like this and I angrily expressed my feelings, and then I said something like ""Donnie, Sean, whatever your name is!"" (Sean is the name of my partner - who is nothing like Trump!) - I then left and spoke to my old school friend and described how trapped I felt. It then changed to another aspect of this gathering... Melania Trump was there and she was ordering me drinks, and then she was standing on the bar table and dancing. I remember eating lots of cake."
"I was wind surfing and the wind was good so I was going back and forth. It was warm and tropical. I wind eventually died down and I decided to head out further becuase sometimes the wind has moved further out on the water. Instead of the water getting deeper it got shallower and then I saw foundations in the water for building a resort. People were there and they were young. I saw Donald Trumps son and then I noticed a teenager. I realized the teenager was Donald Trump and somehow he could blend in. I thought it was funny and went and brought his son to him and said, ""Here is your son. (wink, wink) Donald looked a little surprised I had figured out it was him."
It was as if I was in a banking hall me my son and workmate queuing to withdraw money mr trump was one of the tellers so it was my turn I went straight to his desk and my workmate followed we greeted him present withdrawal slips he started chatting with us making some jokes and he stood up and told us to wait coz he wanted to make some inquireriesfirst in one of the offices so before he came back I woke up
"It was around dusk, outside a public hall near my residence. The community's a gated, densely wooded environment, so I was surprised to see very large crowds swarming in. There seemed to be people from all over the world heading into the speaking auditorium. As I followed the crowd, I ran into a suited and lively gentleman of odd colour and loose hairpiece. I don't remember much of what we spook, but it was very physical and friendly. The Donald came of as brash and youthful, while at the same time exuding a rather paternalistic charm. In the midst of our talk he he ushered me in to the speaking hall where I watched him bound up the stage. He began to speak but I don't remember much- at this point a sense of distance and vague loneliness arose in me. I think the dream ended or shifted somewhere then."
"I am sick and am terribly congested. Last night I spent most of my night awake but had snatches of sleep. When I laid on my back with my head propped up I got the most sleep however this is when the Trump dream came at me. He was trying to drown me, holding my face under water! I would fight him and come up for air, I remember thinking his little fingers aren't strong enough I can get out of the water if I try hard enough! When I broke free and pulled my head out of the water I was rolling over on my side. Each time I returned to my back the dream repeated itself. no other details, horrible night!"
"Some how there was a natural disaster (flood) and in trying to save ourselves, I ended up in a life boat/row boat with Trump and his son. We travelled to safety and ended up at a hotel or apartment building and he went off to do his political thing and I tried to figure out where I was going to end up. He was nice in the dream, sort of comforting, not leader like, but in control of himself. I seemed to be calm too even though there was severe issue. there were other people in the boat with us. The waters were not raging or anything, but I do remember being near the home that I grew up in."
"I've had 3 dreams, I'm married to him, or he is my boyfriend, he is intimating. I'm part of his family and am proud of his daughter"
"In my dream my wife and I are traveling in Germany and stop at a McDonald's. I try to order in German, with very poor results. The woman behind the counter rolls her eyes at me and then responds in English, French and Italian, obviously trying to show me how multicultural she and other Europeans are as compared to boorish Americans. Trying to get back at her, I ask her in broken Pig Latin if she understands me. To my dismay she responds in fluent Pig Latin. Desperate to retaliate in some way and wipe off the smug look on her face I look her squarely in the eye and defiantly state, ""Adolf Hitler!"" She is momentarily stunned, but then the smug look quickly returns and she fires back, ""Donald Trump!"" All I can say back to her is ""Ah, touche."" At this point I woke up, literally laughing out loud, which has never happened to me before."
"Donald Trump was on the back of a pizza box, pizza being made of pure sweet kernel corn. He was making that duck face he does and was giving us a thumbs up. On the top lid of the pizza box, it said, three times in three rows, ""this pizza is fully supported by Trump."" My brother then sold the pizza to a random lady for $10. It was much like a drug deal."
"I was outside, in Golden Gate Park, with my 10-year old daughter. A group of men and boys were marching toward us, armed with long sticks that had painted white tips. Someone at the park said that these groups had been traveling throughout the city and attacking mostly women. Before we could leave, they were upon us and began asking me questions about being a woman, a mother, and where was my husband? Then, one man and one boy began hitting me with the sticks. Two women were there ""doing the paperwork"" with clipboards in their hands. I asked why they would be a part of this and a blonde-haired child hit me again. After it was over, I called my boss (I got the impression that she was a powerful woman) and asked how something like this could happen, in San Francisco, of all places? She said it is ""the reality of the new regime"" and no one could talk about it. My gay male friends (with the financial means) said they were leaving the country."
Donald trump was hunting me he gave me an hour to run and survive while he chased after me trying to shoot me down he had others doing the same famous actors that in my dream were good friends with me now were hunting me also along side donald trump...i was running through different locations including a car junk yard a mall and different other locations i knew my time was about to be up and i was going to survive so i got in an elevator and started riding it up and down while they chased me up some stairs up and down finally time was up and they stopped chasing me and i survived...through out the whole chase i was shot at multiple times by donald trump but he missed them all...then the dream changed to where it was a small kid version of donald trump looking through some old junk he found an old skateboard where i was going to steal it from him i took it from him looked at his face getting sad looked at the skateboard and it had an old trump sticker on it i was told by someone else that it ran through his family for generations so me feeling bad gave it back to him and thats when i awoke
"He hired me to be his personal assistant, but I also did personal things such as changing his sheets on his bed while he had a bathe, He was paying me 501 (whatever that means) he was a very nice boss, There was a lot of people in his home making drama and I asked him If I should ask them to leave and he told me 'yes', I woke up feeling awesome!"
"One night or early morning in April of 2016, I dreamed that Donald Trump was at my door, and I let him in. Although I could not see him clearly, there was no doubt it was he. Then he was sitting on the edge of the sofa in the living room. It was as if he had just come in and taken a seat, but was not interested in leaning back and sitting for a while. He was not interested in conversation. It was as if he were waiting for me to do something to help him. I knew immediately what it was he needed, I just did not know why he chose me. Then I immediately thought he was weary and looked tired. I was overtaken with sorrow for him, and was overwhelmed with compassion for him and his situation. I felt he urgently needed my help. He desperately needed my help, and there was no doubt about that in my mind. I kept thinking: Why is this wealthy, wealthy man in my house? Why is he here with me? He can rest anywhere in the world. I then had a stronger feeling that he was exhausted, thirsty, and just plain worn out as if he had been fighting in a battle. He just needed a place to lay his head. It was as if he was an officer far from his headquarters and was using a local residence to stop by as in the olden days. I just kept thinking over and over: Why would he stop here looking for a place to rest? My house is not suitable for guests, especially someone like him. I have not even cleaned up in a while. I was embarrassed because I did not have a fancy place to accommodate this prosperous businessman. I finally realized that he knew he could find safe haven in my home. He knew I would welcome him and not turn him away. He knew that I knew he had been in battle. I then felt he needed water too. I went to the kitchen to try to find a fancy glass to put water in. I remember turning on the tap and thinking this water is not fit for him. My family and I don’t even drink it. I did not want to give him a bottle of water either. That would be really tacky. I then looked at my glasses and thought they looked dirty. I don’t exactly remember, but it seems like I finally did give him some water in a glass. Then I told myself: You have to prepare a bed.Now.There is no time to waste. Don’t keep him waiting. I went to another room and was trying to straighten the bed and covers. I thought there were debris, books, and other stuff everywhere, and I was picking if off, trying to find a place to put it. I thought the floor needed vacuuming. I wanted it to be clean, but I thought there was no time for that. I simply had to show him where he could rest, and I had to do it quickly. I went back to the living room, and it was completely dark. I did not see him or his face at first, then as I was looking down on him, he leaned back and looked toward the light from the lamp to look at me, and I could clearly see it was he. His hair was even that classic looking strawberry blondish-grayish-brown. After he saw that it was I, he backed out of the light but was still sitting on the sofa. I knew he would not move until I gave him directions. I reached out to take him by the hand to lead him to the room I had prepared. I clearly remember touching the top of his hand. He nudged my hand away as if to say: I can get up. I’m not that old yet. At first I was a little offended, but then I thought it was just his ego. Nevertheless, I knew without a doubt he would not refuse a place to rest and waited for me to show him the way. I remember feeling happy that he needed my help, and I was willing to help him. By the end of the dream I realized I had the greatest need - the need to accommodate him, so he could be revitalized. That’s all I remember."
"If I remember correctly, I fell asleep yesterday afternoon watching the CNN previews to the RNC. I dreamed that Donald Trump had been a family friend for years and was about to marry into my family. We were walking together in the streets of another city--maybe Washington, DC--Trump, some of his entourage, me, and some of my family, and it was the eve or first day of the RNC. I felt that I knew Trump and even loved him as a family friend, but still there was no way that I could vote for him. I didn't know if I'd told him this yet. We started to turn down into an alley full of colorful protest signs and campaign signs, and I could see a huge group of protesters coming from the other side of the alley. The alley wasn't dark or too enclosed. I wasn't frightened, but apprehensive of how the group and Trump would greet each other. Trump and the others in our group slowly backed away and started walking down the main street to avoid the protesters--wisely, I thought--but I lingered, reading the signs posted on the fence. The signs were on posterboard, white, hot pink, and other colors, and there may have been a more formal printed sign with a list of rules. Also, some barrier was erected, like a piece of wrought-iron fencing or a rope, that would slow down the protesters. I got to thinking, ""He's already married, so whom could he be marrying? My Aunt Edna? Maybe one of my cousins or one of my distant cousins."" Later, I was in some political office looking out the window watching people mill around on the street below. I was probably on the second or third floor. Actually, the street was nearly empty, wet, like just after a rainstorm, with some protest signs and political handouts lying in the streets. I felt we were in Washington, DC. I think this was an office full of anti-Trump liberals. I walked through several busy offices full of paper. A woman seated at a large wooden desk, and on the phone, mentioned Trump. She was white, bespectacled, thin maybe, middle-aged. I think she wanted to interview him or to confront him or give him a piece of her mind. I thought of mentioning that I knew Trump and might get him for an interview, but I decided not to name-drop and thought that he might be too busy for such an interview anyway, or not interested."
"I dreamed I was in a wheelchair that Donald Trump had invented. It had big wheels that could go up and down stairs very quickly and easily. I was able to stand and walk, but enjoyed riding around in this chair."
"I had a dream I was in NY and walked by so called apt and Trump was outside of door then invited me in, he Sat down and was writting a check of what i saw 252000.00. It was a green check then he didn't give it to me but I was talking to him about politics and how I was going to support his election and vote. While I was talking he wrote a note on a memo paper but I didn't read it . I asked him about the check so he wrote another one of 62000.00 but never knew how to wrote it he asked me how would he write a check of 252thousand I wrote it on paper its 252, then 000 zeros. It was almost as if he was only playing around. Then I looked back and saw Mrs Obama drive up the apt had big doors and clear Windows . I meantioned to him she stopped in front of apt. Then I told him I was in need of money I shouldn't of never said that he ignored everything , and that was all about the dream."
"I can't remember where we were, but it was combative. We were in an office, it looked like a campaign office. I was trying to reason with the Donald. He had a small rotary saw and started to come at me with it. We wrestled around for a little bit and I stopped him from cutting me. I remember the feeling, I felt the feeling of a tyrant that was in control. And because we had engaged in a fight, I felt that my family was in trouble so I got my mom in the car and drove her to safety."
"I dreamt I was leaving my pub in my town when a done up flash limo came past with dollar signs all over it and police surrounding the car, everyone around me was like ""oh Donald trump must be visiting us to get us to vote"" (I live in whitianga, nz) as I was walking home with my boyfriend, Donald had pulled over, he was being driven by a women, and I was like hi Donald trump and he was like how's it going and I was like could I please have a photo he was like sure so we started taking silly selfies and I ended up in hi lap and laughing and giggling and then I was like I should go and he goes no stay and I said I better and he was like ok and then I left him and tried to look at all the photos but my snap chat was all weird and wouldn't let me see them. Then I woke up"
I had a dream Donald trump was in presidency and he had left his wife for another woman .. he was know as the first president to re marry in the white house.
I dreamt that I was at a dinner party and Trump was there. It was pleasant. After a while I got up to go sit away from the table and Trump came over and sat next to me. I asked him a question about how he felt or thought and he answered it deeply. We talked for a while. I felt close to him; it was an genuine and intimate conversation. It turned into a bed and we fell asleep. I woke once and he had thrown his leg over me. I went back to sleep. I awoke he he was sleeping sprawled on top of me. This didn't feel sexy just close. He got up and was still in his clothes from the night before. He was saying that he would set up a house for me.
"I know I was ready to travel somewhere, but for the time being I was in a cafe' type setting with a very small group, and some family and friends. I was hanging out in a booth when the Donald came in and sat at our table. He seemed calm, happy, genuinely nice. He was wearing a nice suit, and was pleased to be there. A small line had formed to greet him. Not much excitement, just him smiling and greeting. I was relieved for non drama. It seemed like his family could join us at any time. I shimmied out of the booth because I had little interest in meeting these people, and I saw his campaign posters folded neatly nearby, so I thought I'd bring them to him so he could hand them out, and, ask for an autograph on one for me. Why not, right? The posters were wet, they would never hold any signature. They wouldn't unfold without tearing. I thought maybe just one for me... but I gave up and went back to my own travel plans."
I found myself walking across a large street with Donald and Melania Trump. We were accompanied by the paparazzi and members of his campaign staff. Melania was right next to me and she kept smiling at me and I felt like she was trying to give me a sense of reassurance like everything is going to be alright. I was thinking they are going to ask me some questions and at some point I was given a wadded up piece of paper with some notes scribbled on it. I couldn't make sense out of the notes. I couldn't imagine why on earth they would choose me to speak because I'm not all that impressed with Mr. Trump........his wife had a nice smile........
"I dreamed that Donald Trump wanted to hire me to run his Shipping company, Trump Shipping."
"I've had a couple of dreams about Donald Trump and they involve an erotic relationship that is never consummated. He's usually manipulating my attraction to him by having me do favors for him, and although I know he's manipulating me, there's something very comforting about my dreams. I can't quite explain why, but I trust his intentions, and although he is physically distant, surprisingly, he is very present and available. Most of the dreams involve situations that create anxiety where I am attempting to accomplish a task he has requested of me, and I can't quite explain it, but I feel very safe when he appears."
I dreamed I was talking to donald trump we were sitting and talking I don't remember any feelings or the conversation but he was there talking to me
White people start to be racist and they think they are the only one who deserve to be in america. I was very upset in my dream and woke up crying!
"Last night I dreamed Donald Trump was standing in front of a hug mirror with a white dress shirt and trousers. I clearly see his reflection. Next, he puts on his red tie and black jacket. His reflection disappears. I begun screaming. It alarmed me so much, I started screaming the blood of Jesus. My husband woke me up.He asked what was I dreaming. I said, ""Donald Trump had no reflection in the mirror."" My husband asked me, ""What scripture?"" He knows God gives me scriptures in my sleep. I replied, ""Ephesians 1:3"" As he read it, I went back to sleep."
"I'm running all over the place, from a underwater cave to a snowy mountain, for some reason I get the strong feeling I'm looking for Mr. Donald J. Tump's secret lair. After being faked out at the underwater cave hideout I find the lair inside the mountain. Inside I find an old friend who then tells me that she is Trump, she pulls of a wig and she then is bald and has bleached eyebrows and a tan line from hell."
"It was a very long dream, and Donald Trump was only a part of it. I remember he was courting me, he was very sweet to me, and wanted to have an affair with me. I knew we had so much age gap, and that I am not suited to be his wife, so I just laughed but I was flattered that he was being that way to me. I dont want to have an affair with him though. lol"
"My dream actually doesn't involve Donald, but his family. I'm on a bus with Melania and Ivana and her husband. It's really crowded and Melania is standing and I'm sitting between Jared and her. They're talking about all of the people that are going to be at an event they're going to. I get off at a stop to take a rapid bus instead of the slow bus that they're on. There's a fireworks show going on around projections of buildings in Las Vegas."
"Me and my friend won the school science fair. The winners meet the president and because this year was elections, we got to see the swearing in. We had front row seats. It was us then the stage. When Trump is about to be sworn in, this man in a ski hood stands up and yells "" I make America great!"" He shoots and I have this Matrix view on the bullet. I stand up and the bullet hits me in the chest. Because of the force of the bullet, I am forced on the stage, me sprawled at Donald Trump's feet. By this time the police have tackled the assault man. I was rushed to the hospital in Trumps own limousine. Him and his orangeness looming above me. In the end,Trump adopts me (I'm a orphan. My parents died in a car crash.) and I wake up (irl) when Trump hugs me when the official adoption papers are completed."
"I was outside a temporary shower at a Trump Rally. I was standing with a group of men who were there to make sure no one interrupted his shower. We had towels for him, but made jokes that he probably had his on Trump towel. And I remember thinking wtf why am I here and why is this ok."
"Dreamed that Trump & I were lovers, and that his wife was expecting. After he left, I kept thinking that he will find out the problems I'm facing, and he will return & be generous."
I had a dream he won the election by 10 votes
"I had a dream like Donald Trump was ruling in my country, in Albania. His office was right next to my house and he could also speak my language. My cousin was working with him and she is just 15. He claimed that our roads here should be fixed and then he started fixing everything. Then when I was walking down my street he came as a thief and he wanted to steal my phone. I lied to him and said my phone is not worth it because it is broke. Than my cousin was all like ''Let her go''. I ran home and my mum had a wooden stick in her hand and she said that she was going to hit Trump. He had steal a kid from our school and he was going to drive his car to run away. I somehow got superpowers and killed Trump and saved the kid."
Last night I had a dream where I saw Donald Trump dressed in a business suit sitting comfortably on top of this bed. He was surrounded by many people—they looked like reporters. Trump was casually talking to the reporters.
I had to sleep with Donald trump. There were no beds left to sleep in so i had to sleep with Donald.
"Me and a lot of other people were watching a film about Donald while he was in the theatre with us. The movie theater was located within a super market, or sort of in the basement of one. Under a table above the theater was someone from my old school who could ask people downstairs if they wanted snacks through a wormhole. Near where I was sitting was this hot man who had a girlfriend and he looked a bit like Brian Cox (just a lot better), so I was sort of hitting on him. Donald paused the film but he never told us how long the break would be. The boy under the table was selling some more stuff when we got upstairs, but I kind of wanted to step outside for some fresh air, when the cute guy's girlfriend (or fiancée) asked him to get something from the car, so naturally I walked with him. We were all wearing pyjama's and comfy slippers, and it was freezing outside (though it didn't feel cold). Outside, he went to his car and I saw two people who were also from my old school but they ignored me (I felt embarrassed because of my pyjamas). Then my best friend came up to me with some other people and said he got a text that Donald was angry because we missed the beginning of the second half of the film, and we had two options: pay a fine of thousands of euros, or make a rhyme with a lot of ""I""-sounds. My friend and I both decided to go for a rhyme because there was lots you could do with it like ""I missed you"" and ""clit"" to express regret (I don't even know why). Then I beckoned pretty boy over to tell him about the text, but he had gotten it as well, so we went back to the theater and everyone was sort or rooting for me while I did my poem. I think I was hanging upside down? Donald seemed happy enough anyway."
"I was in a seemingly ordinary room, white-walled and minimally furnished, when something unusual caught my eye. Near the leg of a chair was a tiny little human, no more than two inches high. Closer inspection revealed that it was Donald Trump! Trying to figure out what was going on, I remembered hearing that this room had been designed as a sort of art installation by the punk rock impresario Malcolm MacLaren. All the furniture was subtly oversized in order to make one feel smaller, maybe even bring back memories of navigating the grown-up world as a child. But what I was seeing now was a much greater shift of scale than I would have expected. Just how big is this furniture, if it makes a grown man look only two inches tall? I knew that Malcolm MacLaren had been rich, but it would have cost a fortune to build an installation to a scale like that! Then I realized that my scale was perfectly ordinary in relation to the furniture, which could mean only one of two things. If the furniture were vastly oversized, then I too must be an enormous giant, so that if I left this room I would be blundering through the city like godzilla... but that seemed unlikely. I was pretty sure that I remembered being in ordinary scale to the world outside this room. The other possibility was that Donald Trump is actually only two inches tall. That made a lot more sense, given the extent of his overcompensatory bluster. I wondered if it might help if other people came to perceive this."
"I had a dream where he became a professor at my college. He taught African dancing. He had everyone throw the desks and chairs out the window. First, Mr. Trump was wearing a suit. Then he was wearing a leopard print jumpsuit and gold chain with a gold cross on it. He taught the class a dance that consisted of jumping, wild gesticulating and walking like an Egyptian. He told the class ""make sure you jump out of nowhere before you boogie. Jump out of absolute nowhere, like a dog that's happy to see you when you get home from work. And when someone takes a picture off the wall, jump out from behind the picture. The blacks do that all the time before they boogie."""
Married to the man
I was an agent of the secret service tasked with guarding the Oval Office. President Trump entered the room smiling and walked right up to me and introduced himself before stating that he's never seen me before in the White House. I shook his hand and spoke calmly while looking him directly in the eyes. He seemed very friendly and intelligent. We had a brief conversation before my team was alerted of a terrorist threat aimed at D.C. The dream ended with me dying and my spirit leaving my body and ascending towards the sky. My view pans over the entire country and showed explosions and chaos everywhere.
"A group of townspeople on the street corner.The loudest mechanical sound comes from behind us.it is three huge jet liners flying low and fast right over our heads. They blow all of our hair into a mess piled on our heads. We all have Trump hair. The planes all,crash into the river, one on top of the other. I hear a scream from my store. They need me. Their parents are old and in trouble. I run to help them. I get inside the store and I am alone. I something is wrong with my ear. My children are looking for me. I force myself to wake up. I feel a lot of anxiety. 
"
"I just had a dream that I saved Donald trumps life in a movie theater. I was part of the secret service and mark cohen, a journalist, was sitting next to me in the row and he just couldn't listen to trumps bs anymore so he put both hands on Donald's throat and starts strangling. He did that thing in movies where the one guy is talking so much but his voice is getting quieter because the other character is drowning tuning him out because he can't listen anymore like he's having this realization then mark puts both hands around his throat and I grab mark. We tumble over the front row. The movie we we were wartchjng was some black and white cowboy film. I think I'm going to become a national hero and somehow everyone hears about it but when it's time to acknowledge me in front of everyone I'm standing in a room on the upper balcony in what's supposed to be congress for this big savior acknowledgment and instead it's more like a giant sea world place with tall glass behind the presidents podium and everyone knows I saved Donald trump even my dad who's super proud of me. And we're all waiting for Donald to acknowledge my heroics on national tv and instead he thanks the second guy the second agent who jumped in after I already pulled mark cohen the journalist off him. And I say I'm the hero and that's classic Donald. He shook my hand and thanks you to your face but he can't acknowledge he really was helped so he'd rather acknowledge a fake narrative where he wasn't really helped. Where the actual person who helped him. Because he just likes giving big fuck yous to everyone with a big smile on his face. And as I said that Barack obama is standing next to me and he does this acknowledgment frown as soon as Donald acknowledges the other guy and slowly pulls out a crumpled pack of camel lights and gives me one. I handle it really gently because i want to save it for when I drink later at the party. I almost break it and bend it to where it's not smokeable. And I get nervous. Then I see barack walking out from the audience bleachers where we all are. He's all hunched over and he looks really defeated. And I feel bad for him. Then some guy crashes into the audience from a Segway scooter thing. He's got his hair dyed like that trendy gray silver anime color everyone is doing now. He yells ""hey everyone did you know the new mountains of margar is out"" and this other nerd in the audience says ""mountains of margar? I believe it is called the chapter of margargh"" like there was some subtle difference in pronunciation and it's like the biggest fantasy hit in the world. So I never get my secret service acknowledgment officially but everyone knows it was me and congress ends at sea world kind of place then turns into dungeons and dragons convention. Amd the nerds were really annoying. I don't know what happened to mark cohen he was taken away and never heard from again but in the news he was disgraced. Oh and I remember being on tv and going to shake Donald's hand and my friends all hated me I didn't resist or something like throw shit at him."
"I was Donald Trump's nanny for his son. I came over to, I guess his house, and he, another, man, and his son who was about ten years old were playing in the courtyard. Donald Trump and the other man were firing guns with live ammo at each other. His son had a water gun. Nobody was hurt. Later, I talked to Donald Trump and said, ""Shame on you for putting your son in a dangerous situation like that. You should not shoot guns at each other with your son in the way. You should not shoot guns in front of your son."
"I was at a cocktail party at a swanky mansion, and Trump walked in, and had a different wife , blonde, and a different child, I guess that was me, although I felt like myself. He wanted u us to go see his property down by the river, so we got in the car and the blonde drive us around till we came upon a big Greek revival type building, sort of looked like mausoleum actually, and he said it was an apartment building heheand bought and did I like it? I said yes, it was beautiful, and then several young women came bounding out, wearing bikinis and talking about what they had made for dinner. We almost hit the off kilter gate backing out of the driveway. Then I woke up. Earlier in the dream, I was being chased in my car by one of his security officers, and I sped up to get away and lost control of my car and went down a wooded cliff in the dark and thought I was going to die. I landed safely in a bunch of bushes, at the house that became the other dream."
"1st dream- Donald Trump became my housemate. My room mates and I were all very unhappy about it, however we tried to be polite."
I was flying over him. He was totally by himself. I landed and we walked down the streets. Some people did recognize him others did not. We stopped in a coffee shop and was mingling as people approached. No presidential protection. Like Donald escaped.
"I was in some kind of dormitory or rehab center where we were supposed to gather for Donald Trump's wedding. We went to a large room with white flooring, kind of plain looking. There was a brown/gray curtain and Trump's voice coming from behind the curtain but he was not seen, and there was no evidence of a wedding. At the end, I ask someone nearby if I can borrow a towel."
I dreamt the other nite that i had went to get tested at community of hope clinic an was tested positive my pcp told me she will do all she can for me an i hav to fight fight hard becaue my age an other heath issueing make me vunerable i remeber crying an sad an disgusted that a country china would allow its citizens to run wet mar k ets that could destory almost the.

"Moving into a huge, but partly decrepit house with my sister and probably other family members. We were deciding what room my sister would have, and cleaning it. Butterflies flew out from behind the mirror on the dresser, The bedspread had huge red and orange flowers on it. I was worried because parts of the house were in serious disrepair, but the house belonged to me, it wasn't derelict. There seemed to be a lot of other people there too... not family members, but what looked like homeless men sleeping in the rundown shabby portions of the house. I was trying to sweep and clean those areas too, but there were rats and I didn't want to hurt them."
"It was night time and I was with my younger brother and sister, we were walking in the with tattered clothes on and they were soiled as well as our faces, other people were walking around with no real purpose the we decided to check a car that had the back door open and found a few pieces of food and candy then I had lifted the seat cushion up and there was a small safe that had about four or fivr hundred dollars in it but we were not that excited about it because all businesses were closed and had been closed for years, I stashed the dough in my shirt pocket"
"Not sure whether they are dreams or thoughts just before falling asleep: I stand at a gathering of the president and his followers, remove him and put someone in their places, who will work with Dr. Fauci and others, who follow the Constitution; remove dangerous cabinet officials and calm down scared and angry people, as they take the measures to bring the pandemic under control. Elizabeth Warren is brought in and Kamala Harris as A.G. Dangerously biased judicial appointments are nullified. The dream shifts from scene to scene and gets vague, as my role is taken over by the ""Good Government"" people."
"Nearly twelve years ago I experienced my first and only lucid dream, (as far as I know, at least). I was on vacation in Florida with my family, just following Christmas of my 5th-grade year. We were stay in a comfortable motel suite in Cape Canaveral that night. We'd been in Florida for roughly a week at this point. I was sleeping on the hide-a-bed. That morning, I woke up very early; perhaps 4:30 or 5:00 AM. I recall that no one else was awake at the time. I helped myself to a snack, and then briefly played with some of the new stuffed toys I'd got on vacation. I had slept well the night before, and I recall feeling reasonably well rested. Despite this, I decided to go back to bed to pass the time before the rest of my family woke up. It was at this point, after I went back to bed that morning, when I experienced my lucid dream. (At this point in my vacation, I was missing about a week of school.) I remember dreaming about being in my class at school. The teacher had brought one of school's televisions into the room, and we were all sitting in our desks, in the darkened classroom, watching some movie on the TV. There was a bit sunlight coming through the window in the corner of the classroom, so it wasn't completely dark. I also remember that we were all only somewhat paying attention to the TV; we were also talking amongst each other, doodling, playing with our school supplies, and disrupting the TV. (I think I had initially recalled what I had dreamt we'd been watching, but regretably I don't remember anymore.) Anyway, at some point during this classroom scene, I became aware that I was dreaming. I remember flying up out of my desk and doing loop-de-loops in air inside the classroom. The ceiling was dark and impossibly high; I was flying perhaps fifteen feet in the air above my classmates. The class was still watching the movie, but they might have also noticed my flying around. (Can't recall exactly when I realized I was dreaming. It could have been before or during the time I dreamt I was flying around in the classroom.) At this point I was definitely aware of my dreaming, and I also remember feeling somewhat euphoric. I wanted to fly around some more, so I flew out the classroom door and then through one of the school's exits near my classroom. I remember flying into the air above the playground, and then noticing one of my classmates standing on the ground looking up at my, so I landed and approached him. (I don't recall whether or not it was recess; I believe there were other kids on the playground, but no one else was especially near us.) I remember thinking I was psychically connected to him at that moment, so I said to him something like, ""Derek! I'm dreaming! I'm in Florida right now, but you're back home! We must be sharing a dream!"" I remember making up a codeword phrase and telling it to him, and then I told him to repeat it back to my in real life when I saw him next, so that we'd know we were communicating telepathically. I don't remember if he replied in the dream, and unfortunately I also no longer recall what the codeword phrase was that I had used, although I remember remembering it for several years later. Next, my family woke me up; I was somewhat annoyed about being roused from such an intense dream, but I got over it. I've remembered most of that dream ever since. Curiously, I was a sort of a shy kid, and I wasn't especially good friends with Derek, (though we weren't enemies either), so I never actually bothered to ask him if he'd had a similar dream and if he'd remembered the codeword phrase. I think I reasoned that if he had dreamt the same thing I had, he would approach me with the codeword phrase. I suppose now I'll never find out if it was a psychic experience, although I certainly imagined that it was at the time."
"The dream began with playing golf with my bestfriend/lover (he was this in the dream and he is in real life). The colors of green were very vibrant on the golf course. At the last hole of the round is when i realized i was in a dream because i saw this extremely huge, yellow slip-n-slide. Real life could never have something this sweet, thats how i knew i was in a dream. My favorite cousin and her sister all of a sudden appeared and we started getting ready in the house to put on the clothing that was required to use the slip-n-slide. I remember going up to my best friends dad and asking him specifically what we had to wear to be able to use it. Even though i knew it was a dream i was still really excited to play on it. It never occured to me until i started typing this description that i didnt even think to let my cousin Sarah know i was in a dream and she was just part of my dream too. I don't remmeber actually using the slip and slide even though we spent so much time getting ready for it. The next thing i rememeber is being outside my elementary school playing some game with a small yellow ball and a larger ball that didnt have a specific color. It seemed that there were tons of other people around me, my age, playing the game but none of them had faces. Not in a creepy way, it just seemed like i didn't care to see who they were. I had a major role in the game, for some reason i was the one that got to start off every round by throwing the balls (alternating small yellow to large every other round) at the wall. My favorite teacher/[principle from high school that just came out as a lesbian was there directing the game. I just assume she was there because i have been meaning to go into the school in real life and talk to her about another teacher in the school that is male and had sexual relations with a student just after she graduated but not many people except for me know about it. I specifically remember the principle making a comment about how i was doing an awful job at the kicking the ball to start off each round. Just like i have been doing in real life for the past month and a half, i kept my face covered with my hands because a month and a half ago i got a septorhinoplasty to fix my deviated septum and change the outside look of my nose a bit. I used it as my excuse for how i couldn't hit the wall when i kicked the ball, i kept kicking the large ball way over the school. The elementary looked identical to real life except for the wall we were playing against and i never turned to my right to see if the playground with sand was there in my dream. My principal, when she was saying that i was bad at kicking mentioned the name of my ex boyfriend who was a soccer superstar. Last night in real life i watched some of ""She's the Man"" a soccer movie with Channing Tatum and i also ran into a girl from high school that asked me if i was still dating this Tyler guy. I told her how i haven't talked to him in 4 months. Even though we dated for over 4 years, it still bugs me how after almost 2 years of not dating people still ask about it. I think thats why he was brought up in my dream but i never did turn around to see if he was there. At some points i think the way i was watching my dream might have panned out from me being in my body to me wathing overhead. In the ball/soccer part of my dream i don't remember thinking to myself ""this is a dream"" so maybe i fell out of my lucid state. Hope this was enough detail.."
"Whenever I do experience a lucid dream it is still vague although the dramatic changes in my abilities and surroundings become much more apparant. In the past several months I have had 2 that i can remember. In the first one i was doing a construction job(prior actual event) and my partner fell off a plank and landed on the stairs(did not actually occur). I felt apathetic towards his fall and instead of attending to him i noticed that the far side of the house seemed to resemble the exterior of a castle. At which point i became aware that I was dreaming. Upon looking at the wall i was again quickly distracted by a ray of sunlight moving through the house that drew my attention to the fact that i was no longer in a house but rather a fortress of some sort. As often with actual events i felt anxious and frustrated that i was allowing my distraction to hinder production. I attempted to go back to what i was previously working on only to find that i was now on the third floor of a building very similar to one i had i had spent several months at shortly before starting the house (which happened to be the job i hated and quit over). However in the dream i did not hate it and felt i was in control rather than working for somebody else. I began to creatively build walls but found that i had built a structure that didn't seem to have a purpose. After what seemed like a brief period of working on this job the heavy equipment outside began to change into massive robots. I became very worried that i would be injured and i attempted to change them back into what they were. However, they instead became massive cog like structures grinding together and into the ground. As they continued to grind together the world around them was being pulled into them and despite my strongest efforts to change what was happening the building and myself were slowly being pulled into them. At this point i either woke from the dream, stopped dreaming, or can no longer remember the events. In the other recent lucid dream i had, I was had different powers such as the ability to move things with my mind and fly. However, I initially wasn't aware that I was dreaming. When it did occur to me, i began to quickly lose the abilities. This made me extremely anxious and frustrated. I could no longer fly but had a fading ability to distort or move objects. As this ability continued to weakin I would change my landscape and desparately try to move different things. Towards the end of the dream, the mother of a friend i had in elementary school, whom i wasn't fond of but didn't hate, began to approach me and distort me as i had previously done to inanimate objects. I focused so much energy on fighting her but was unable to overpower her with my mind and i am quite sure that at this point i was pulled into consciousness by my own frustration."

"I was in a warehouse with my mentor; he showed me the painting of a white owl he had made in response of a watercolour I'd made for him of a brown owl. The brown owl symbolized him and the white one symbolized me. Suddenly, my parents arrived and he became afraid we'd be accused of having a sexual relationship when in reality we simply shared a special bond. I was bothered by his phobia that we might be misinterpreted. It made me feel rejected, and thus lonely. The dream switched to me being driven to a house for a college party. The atmosphere was not one of ""fun"". On the contrary, it was even a bit eerie. To continue, in this part of the dream I was a male, with whom in real life I share significant history with. On my way to the reunion I noted the sky was starry purple, orange, and black. The neighbourhood was luxurious, though there was lustrous black plastic veiling the water of every pool. Inside, the house was dominantly a dark peach tone. I met a girl and we discussed Freud's theory of tongue slips as well as English grammar. At this point the ""observer"" in my dream realized whilst still watching that my subconscious was merely responding to recent reading assignments and pointed out that my dream recollection of language technicalities was quite poor in comparison to that of my psychological studies. Next, she also rejoiced at my mind's ability to at last create a shadow character (a different identity undertaken during sleep) and wondered what my choosing that boy as my alter ego symbolized. At this point, everything became dark; however, I strongly believe this was not the blackness of the inside of my eye lids. The darkness FELT like a dream; furthermore, I had a sense of falling. Then, not even the shadows endured, and there was an extended period of nothing. Upon waking up, a lot of the details were blurry, but I was certain of the events which I previously described. My suspicions are that I became more than one person during the dream and that I was to more than one house. Firstly, I can remember the image of a long brown-haired woman with korean features laying on the ground in some form of predicament also in a peach environment. Secondly, I can remember my wearing red robes as I imagined Offred from The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood wear as I carried a grey flag and marched across an outdoors basketball court within small group of kids ( they were clad in the same way) on a cloudy day. I remember the ""observer"" pointing out how marches such as this were important to me in my elementary school back when I lived in Mexico. Also, I might have been in a vaguely dark beach home setting which has appeared in my dreams before, and there is the possibility that at the end, the girl I spoke to was me PHYSICALLY."
"Most of my lucid dreams involve a memory from my past that has happened and I try to change the event somehow a reoccuring lucid dream that I have is from a time when I was about three (in the dream I am my current age, 18) and my parents where fighting over money, my dad would not give my mother drug money and she became mad and pulled a knife on my father, while me 3 at the time (18 in the dream) and my sister 5 at the time and (5 in the dream) were sitting there crying and that is usually when I realise it is a dream and instead of just crying while my mom attacks him and my sister and I call the police like we did at the time I pushed my mom down and saved my sister and my dad and ran out the door, and yelled at my mom that she needs to get help because she is going to loose her children and everyone she loves and be diagnoised with schizophrena and she will hate herself for doing what she did (I always think that maybe if I do this in the dream the outcome of my mother would be different when I wake up) or I tell her whatever I am feeling for her at the time, sometimes I feel sorry, or worried or scarred, whatever I am feeling towards I usually act that way when I realise I am dreaming, and sometimes I only save my sister and not my dad I just leave him there for my mother to attack or I attempt to tell my dad how I am feeling towards him. But most of my lucid dreams have to do with my parents and when I realise I am dreaming I speak my mind to them something I cannot do when I am awake and in my normal state."
"my most recent lucid dream was about 4 - 6 years ago. there would be family gatherings in my grandparents place every year, where myself and most of my cousins would sleepover for a weekend. my grand parents recently renovated their house and most of the backyard. the young ones, including myself at the time, have not been to/seen the old backyard. we were frightened since it was quite dark, mostly because of the thick trees. the renovation opened up most of it and we were finally aloud in and play about. that evening, we were called on for dinner, i was one of the last ones to leave. it was already dark, and it was getting scarier by the second. on my way, i thought someone was behind me. it was impossible since every one had run off. i turned around, then i couldn't move a muscle, something was stopping me. i couldn't see what it was, but whatever it is, it scared the hell out of me. this dream ended as i woke up. a few weeks later, i had the same dream with varying details except for this very same encounter. i knew i had to be dreaming when this happened, i was sweating, and most likely panicking. then this entity took a corporeal form. very vague, but shaped somewhat of a big scary, cat-like creature. i concentrated very hard until i manifested powers of characters from marvel comics, mostly the x-men. i incapacitated the creature just enough to flee. when i woke up, controling the dream seemed as if i was only imagining it, that i was recreating the dream, but how was it that i couldn't control what i was doing in the dream until that very moment of bravery. i never had the dream or anything similar to it again. at least i hope i won't tonight."
"i was dreaming that i was living in a water park (zoo) king of places where they had whales and this kind of animals. i have a lizzard named trixie and she was there too. she was in my room and the ground in my room was made of dirt kind like a desert ground, and the were more lizzards too, they werent the same kind but they look a bit a like and i thought it was pretty neat but then they started attacking trixie and i went to try to stop it. i used my feet (i dont know why) to try to separete them but i end up hurting trixie. i took a piece of her tail out. i didnt realise that until i picked one of the lizzards up which i thought was trixie but it wasnt, the whole time the lizzard with the hurting tale on the ground was trixie. i felt so bad about it. then my dream moved to the whale(the free willie kind) tank. it was a very different tank. the whales were in a closed swimming pool and you could go right in there with them. i wasnt afraid of them like in my other dreams (i normally have very bad dreams about them) so i was there having fun and this is when i realize that i was dreaming. it felt so weird because the moment i realize that i stopped feeling all the great feeling that comes with dreaming... it was pretty disapointing and after a short while i woke up sorry that the dream was over. this aquarium was so nice, it was underground there were tunnels and a lot of people too."
"I was in a house that i don't recognize the rooms were large open spaced almost oversized in content. one room connected to the next no hallways even the bathroom was large didn't have a door. i don't really remember any doors. the house was dark shadowy no lights for all that i knew the bathroom was painted royal blue with all white fictures. there was a large dark wooden dresser in the room connected to the bathroom the top was cluttered with towels, skin care products, hair brushes and such.i looked at everything on the dresser ran my hands over them like i was investigating something new. when i first started wondering the house i keep thinking i was looking for something but couldn't remember what when i came to the bathroom my clothing changed and i suddenly just had on a towel. thats when i realized it was a dream because i asked my self why i was wearing a towel and that this dream didn't make sense. i continued back out of the bathroom thinking i was going to go find whatever it was i was suppose to be finding when i left the bathroom i ran into a man tall dark clothing his face in shadow i thought to myself or at least i thought it was to myself if this is what/whom i'd been looking for but he said no like he'd read my mind when i said what? he said but you will soon and he turned away moving into the shadows i was thinking this is a stupid dream and was going to follow him when i woke up"
"I do know that occasionally I have lucid dreams, although I can't seem to necessarily remember them after a few days/weeks. One which I do somewhat remember, or at least comes to mind, is from a few years ago. I was in the field by the house I lived in, which has a big hill in it. There was lots of other kids there - although I don't remember if I knew them from real life- and I was trying to fly. I often have this type of dream, and can recall having it quite a few times, although not ever in this setting. How I would be able to begin flying, was that I would run as fast and hard as I could for about 50 m, and then crouch and jump in one motion. I would then have to 'flap' my arms really hard to get up. Somewhere in this process, I became lucid and sort of realized that I was dreaming. It was an enjoyable dream though because I yearned to fly in it, so I just tried to let it continue on as it was going- I don't remember trying to change anything. Sometimes I would get up, but sometimes I would just remain on the ground and would have to try again. Once I did get into the air, I no longer had to really flap, but I just soared like a bird. Everyone was watching me and then I would come to the ground, and perhaps try again. Somewhere in the midst of trying to get up repeatedly, I woke up."
"First the dream starts with me siting on a stump, I look around and see that Im in a dark building on the top floor in front of me a see that appears to be a tree with a clock in it only that the clock contains the numbers 1 through 5. the hands of the clock are at the five then it starts to count down. then it hits me it some sort of dooms day clock and it counting down the days until the end. i feel relive that i have five days to stop the clock but then a voice calls to me telling me that no it five hours. this mad me anger, and this was about the time i finally clued in that i was dreaming. so using my dream powers i turned on the light. but only a row of light on my left side turned on. where i saw a counter and somone behind it. teleporting my self to the spot i see a women who hands me a red video rental case. I take it then walked a few feet to the left sat on the couch and played zelda. my brother is already here complaying about somthing but i pay him nohead, just then my ex-girlfreind walk over to me. then I had another on of those moments where i know Im dreaming, for we broke up but yet she acts like we are still together. so i go with it, she sit on my lap and is about to say something, then i wake up."
"One Dream (Happened A Long Time Ago But Some Reason I Still Remember) I Was Out On The Streets And It Seemed Like It Was In L.A. Quite And No One Around Except Two People With Me. We Found An Abanded House And Entered It. When We Got Inside It Was Like A Castle, So Huge And Nice Inside A Small House. When We Got In Their Was A Spiral Stair Case Going Down, Than Once My Friends And I Reached The Bottom We Found Ourselves Inside A Room Filled With Cement Tombs. The Room Would Be A little Bit bigger As The Grant Macewan Cafe is now And There Was At Least 125 Tombs Because The Tombs Were Split Into five Colors And Each Set Of Colors Had At Least 25. The Colors Were, Red, White, Black, Blue And Green. And Each Set Of Colors Had One Totally Different Tomb From The Rest And It Seemed Like It Was The Leader Of That Color. Once Me And My Friends Looked Around For A Bit We All Got Scared And Ran As Fast As We Could Outside And Back To Our Homes, And By The Time I Got Home I Saw People In My House And As I Reached For The Door I Woke Up... I Noticed That It Was A Dream Is When I Was Running Back To My House And Then Just A Short Amount Of Time I Woke Up. So I Dont Really Know If This Counts As A Lucid Dream."
"In my dream I was walking threw my old juinor high school with a lot of people I do not know. Then I see this Boy who I have always had feelings for and he walks up to me. We are talking and he feeds me chocolate. Just one piece, then another, and on the last piece of chocolate he tries to kiss me but I dont let him. I have the chocolate in my mouth and I turn my head alway. Then some time seems to pass. We ( Me this boy and other people) are eatting food in a field. And I become aware that I am dreaming and that I can change what is going on. And even though I am still dreaming I think about him. Like half of my brain is dreaming and the other half is remebering this Boy ( named Chris) I realised that I think about this boy all the time, probably for aleast 2-5 minutes a day and that I can't be with him. I am in a relationship and I think about another person everyday. Which is pretty pathetic because he probably never thinks about me. I leave my 'Thoughts"" and I committe myself to the dream because I realise I can talk to him and 'Be' with him. We start talking while were eatting in the dream and I ask him all these question about him, or how his life is. And Finally before I let myself wake up, I kiss him."
"The dream began lucid. I was in a village that looked middle-eastern and I began walking around examining houses. They had sod roofs and were built out of rocks or bricks. In front of the houses there was a yard,filled with sand, with a wood picket fence. I approached one of these houses at random and walked up the path to the front door. I entered the door and was inside the house. Before I could pay any attention to the details of the interior of the house I spotted a creature that walked in front of the kitchen window. The creature looked like the creature from the movie ""The Village""(M. Night Shamylan(sp)"") I did a flying dropkick from the entrance of the house through the kitchen window and hit the creature, although the impact felt like I just tapped it, the creature ran away. I didn't question the creatures motives and I looked upwards to see if the sky in my dreams resembled the sky when I was awake. When I looked up the sky was clear blue, but I could see Star Destroyers(Star Wars) in the sky. I wanted to fly up and examine these, but my first attempt was a failure. I tried to fly again and succeeded, but the feeling of flying was so weird that I lost the lucidity and the dream converted back into a regular dream."
"I was in a convenience store talking with a friend who was the cashier. A man walked in and I could tell he was going to try to rob the place so I told my friend to get down. He took out a gun and then a monkey (almost like a real version of mojo-jojo from PowerPuff Girls) came around the corner of an isle and also had a gun. He started laughing and shooting the gun in the air, and then I realized it was a dream. I started pushing the human robber with a cart and it seemed like a video game, like I pushed him and he lost energy so I could keep fighting him(he was very big). Once he got strength back he started to push the cart back at me, so I ran to a girl who was in the corner bleeding and I asked her to pretend she was dead until he got there. so he ran after me and when he got to her she stood up and he grabbed her from behind. I then had a gun (I dont know how)so I gave it to her and asked her to shoot him. Since she was dying anyways, she shot the gun through her body and into his to kill him. I went and saw my friend at the front of the store, and then woke up."
"I dreamt that I could fly. I knew I was dreaming because I had dreamt the same thing many times. I was talking/hanging out with my friends ,though I don't remember their faces nor know who they are, i just know our relationships are friends. And sometimes they change faces. For example, I was talking to A, but suddenly A becomes B. Then I was irritated, then I fly (well, not exactly flying, I just felt so light and my body left the ground and rose). I remember I kept rising and I was affraid and I grabed the street light tried to hold on(because I couldn't control the flying). Then it suddenly started over again(from being irritated to body rose). When I was irritated, I was in a classroom or somewhere indoor, but when my body rose, I suddenly was outdoor). And I remember when I was irritated, I felt excited, angry and something I don't remember, one at a time. Then i realized I was dreaming because I had dreamt that my body rises before quite a few times (the settings and the scenes are not the same). Then I said to myself that I can never fly in real life, so let's enjoy the fly. then I could control the direction and the speed of my flying and really enjoyed that. then the dream finished"
"I had a dream that I was in an old farmhouse with a boy that my friend currently my obsessing about. He offered to show me around because he knew that I had never been there. He showed me an old claw footed bathtub that had been turned into a fountain, and then ran off. I thought he wanted to play a game so I chased him. I looked for him for a really long time but couldn't find him anywhere. Then I realized that I wasn't alone on the farm, there was someone else there, though I had not seen them yet I could sense them. I was very scared and uncomfortable. Then all of a sudden I was in a giant bed, the bed was the size of the room and was very soft and comfortable. This is when I realized that I was dreaming, then there was a large fat and hairy man in the bed with me. This made me very uncomfortable so I decided that I wanted to leave. I couldn't move though because the blankets that covered me were so heavy that I was stuck. I knew that the hairy fat man was going to rape me and that there was nothing that I could do to stop him. I screamed, and woke up suddenly."
"I was walking through a neighborhood that was similar to my own, but had tudor style buildings as apposed to the typical bungalow and apartment complexes. I was on my own for a while, just walking along pathways and through school fields. I soon came across a garage sale sign, and decided to go have a look and see what they had. I browsed for a bit, and picked up some old tea cups and pots that i thought would look good in a still life setting for a painting i wanted to do for my portfolio. When i was about to go pay for the items i picked up, the woman who was running the garage sale came up to me that both my parents had died. I stared at her for a minute, and then told her it wasn't true. She insisted that it was true. I told her that it was a dream, and therefore not real, and she began to laugh at me. ""No!,"" I said ""look, i can pinch my arm and I won't feel it"" I did so, and felt nothing threw a triumphant smile at her. I remember then walking out of the garage with my items (and without paying) and headed back to my apartment to set them up to paint."
"The dream i was having was an activity (routine) that i did often during the day time. In the dream i was riding my bike down the street with the objective of going home, but i was really anxious and upset because i had to marry this guy who i didn't know or loved. At the same time i'm trying to think of the most rebellious actions that would get me out of this arranged marriage. So i get off my bike and push my bike through the gate to the front yard. The dream is unusually slow paced (movement is very slow) compared to the rate these thoughts are comming to me. And so i look up and see that there are bright yellow sunflowers planted at the door where there none the day before and i think to myself aloud (in the dream) that i should plant some sunflowers in ""real life"", this quoted statement made something shift and i was becoming aware of how unrealistic my soroundings were. It was simple statement that i would do some planting in ""real life"" that made me more aware that the dream was not real. After that there was strange feeling part awe part confusion with what i was experiencing in the dream."
"The most recent lucid dream that happened to me first started off in a scrambled way with what seemed like random changes of setting. I don't recall how the setting changed or even exactly when but i do know that i acknowledged the change at one time or another. Although the setting changed often there was always one person who was in every scene which was a friend of mine. Most of the scenes took place outdoors and were in unfamiliar areas. Once i had realized that my friend was the only unchanging thing in the dream i began to put sense to everything and realize it was in fact a dream. I couldn't control every aspect of the dream but i was able to control things i would in real life such as my thoughts, actions and how i interacted with the environment. I remember trying to explain to my friend that this was just a dream but he didn't understand what i was talking about and as soon as this started happening i started loosing control over the dream despite my efforts to keep control. More and more parts of the dream were making less sense until i eventually either forget the rest or it ended abrupty."
"The most recent lucid dream I had is actually a kind of re-occuring dream. Since child-hood, I have had dreams where I'm in a house. Although the house always appears different, has different rooms, furniture, etc., it's always the same house. It's always my parents house; sometimes it's new, fancy, and well-kept. Other times it's old, run down, and dirty. The most recent time I had this dream, it was pleasant. I was alone (I always am in the dream) and had discovered a new and hidden room in the house. I think this is around the time I started to realize I was asleep and dreaming; I don't remember exactly what I decided I would do in the dream, but I think it involved feeling excited that I would get to show my boyfriend this room. I think I did some re-arranging and decorating, and also decided that this is where my mother had decided to put away the books my grandfather had given to me when I was a child - I was extremely happy to have found them. (The books have actually been lost for years). The dream this time was pleasant; I remember being content and excited."
"I first have to explain that my ability to remember dreams (and the intensity of the dreams) has increased only recently. I've developed a pretty rough cough/cold, and my doctor gave me this medicine to take before bed; I don't remember exactly what it is (essentially just cough medicine) but one element of it is Codine. I when I've taken this medicine my dreams are more vivid and 'wild', and I tend to remember them when i wake up. Some are exciting and fun, others are ...not 'nightmares', but perhaps a bit more uncomfortable (the context of the dream). In one of my more recent dreams my roommate (and fellow band-member) and I were driving in my van, and although we were ""driving across canada"" the area we were in looked more like a blurry jungle. We ran into more friends, there was odd food being eaten, and...it's hard to remember much more details than that. Something unrealistic happend and then I 'realized' that it as a dream, but continued on. I have a dream that concerned me a few weeks ago that I remember the end of quite well, but maybe that will come up later in the survey?"
"I was walking by this path by my house that i walk by while not dreaming almost every day. I Saw my old friend, one who had moved away because she had got heavily involved in hard drugs( real life) and she recently contacted me and brought up the past and how i didnt try hard enough to save her. In my dream i could hear our conversation and her voice was so close, like she was whispering my ear while i slept. It was so wierd, i felt such fear and anxiety for what would happen next. about half way through her screaming at me i realzied it was all a dream and i tried to change the outcome but it felt like i lost control and was only an observer in the situation. Like i was paralyzed..she threatened to hurt herself again and i kept trying to hide all the objects she used to hurtself with when i knew her, and she kept being one step a head of me, i forced myself to wake up. And when i woke up i was shaken and sweating, which doesnt happen very often."
"I was at my place of work (coffee house) but things were somewhat different, It was larger and there were T.Vs everywhere. I chatted briefly with my boss when I realized I was dreaming. Upon realizing I was asleep I attempted to wake up. I opened my eyes and believing that I was awake returned to work, but although things were closer to normal they were still off. Once again I tried to wake up, and woke up at my parents house. I went out side and found myself in a large field of wheat and my father riding around in circles on a segway type vehicle. I attempted to interact with him normally and then realized I was still asleep. With a growing sense of panic, believing I may be in some type of coma I tried to wake up again. This time I awoke in my own bed at my own house. I went down stairs and began chatting with my roommates who began apologizing to me for breaking some kind of non-sensical, non-existant code. Then someone slammed the bathroom door and I legitimately woke up."
"i was at a party at a friends house, where i was feeling happy, when her basement turned into a claymation ""halloween town"" sort of place like in the nightmare before christmas, and the rest of the dream played out like it was claymation. the mayor from the movie was there and had a giant monster trapped in a cage (in the basement) and it made me feel very anxious being around it, then it escaped. jack skellington emerged out of nowhere, and his ribs were the bones of hands(?) and a geeling of happiness came over me, as i knew he would be able to help me defeat the monster. the basement then turned into the graveyard from the movie with the curly hill where we were battling witches, as the monster just disappeared. then i fell off of the hill which was now a very high cliff, and i was terrified but i knew i was dreaming so i woke myself up before i hit the ground, and then i was covered in a cold sweat. the weirdest part was, i haven't watched that movie in months."
"I do not remeber the exact details of the dream, but this is what I can recall. I remember lying on my back, with my legs crossed as if I was sitting in a chair. I remember this as being part of my dream as well. I remember feeling uneasy and that I was dreaming about something I did not like. I cannot remember what was making me feel so uneasy, just that I wanted to wake myself up and stop the dream from going further. I remember trying to fight to wake up; I remember looking at the clock in my room and it was approx. 3am. I remember how I was laying and I thought that was strange because I was in a position I do not normally sleep in ( the cross legged position). I was feeling almost scared that I could not wake myself up fast enough. Finally I was able to fully wake up and I remember feeling relieved. I tried to recall what I was dreaming about that was causing me to want to wake up so bad, but I still cannot."
"I dreamed I was on a old-style ship and it was in a bad storm. It was dark, raining, windy, lightning etc. I heard a boom and water started to run aboard the ship and it started sinking. As the water poured onto the ship, I climbed to the top of the tallest mast and sat in the crow's next/ lookout post (it was an old ship). As I sat there the ship started to sink. It was raining harder and harder. I knew I was going to die. The water was coming closer and closer as the ship sank. At this point, still asleep, I realized I was dreaming - I thought if I scream loud enough for my mom to wake me (I knew she was home) so I wouldn't sink into the water and die. I screamed as loud as I could over and over but the ship kept sinking. I woke up just as it was about to sink. I realized my mom had been doing laundry in the next room so I could hear the water running as it filled the machine."
"the first one that comes to mind is when i was younger. everything was green and i was at the end of my driveway waitng for the bus, I was yelling at my self because i couldnt walk back up the hill to come home, i was stuck and i was talking to myself both ways, to my dream self and from my dream self to my mind... It was weird. My dream self was trying to walk my mind self thorough trying to wake myself up so i could go home. I remember telling myself to blink my eyes. THey were closed to tight so dreamself was trying to think of ohter ways to wake myself up. It was frustrating and i was scared and i am sure there was anxiety. I eventually did and to this day i still think about it. there are other ones but i cant remember specifics, i just know that i was changing things that i didnt like, or making new scenarioes...most of the time i am talking myself through things... but my mind is ususally in control"
"It was winter and I was driving the new car I recently purchased. I was driving with a hockey player and someone else that I didn't know. When I noticed the dream was third person I knew I was having a lucid dream. I recall trying to test the boundries of my dream and because I have anxiety about my car being damaged I saw a concrete protrusion on the road and I ran into it. The car flipped but all of us were safe outside the car. I knew I wasn't strong enough to flip a car (even in a dream that seems unrealistic to me), but i knew that the hockey player didn't exist and he could flip it no problem because the car didn't exist either. Before I could even ask him he flipped my car back to the right up position and popped the roof back into its origianl position. It was then the dream ended. Also the atmosphere seemed to be from a dream I had earlier( a month or so) where it was dark and snowy outside."
"I dreamed that I was engaged in sexual intercourse with a random girl whom I go to school with, but have never actually met. The dream took place in a few familiar settings that changed from time to time as the dream progressed. At first the dream was quite tacid, in that, I wasn't really aware of the dream or anything, but as the dream moved on to more sexual and affectionate interactions with this girl, it became quite more real and vivid. I was able to move around in the dream, change my physical orientation, navigate (through steps, or floating), rearrange items in the various rooms I was in. The dream was not soley made up of this sexual exchange, but rather, it was the sexual exchange which triggered the lucidity of the dream. After the sexual exchange, I was in and out of familiar buildings (my work, school, LRT terminals, etc). I did not navigate to these different places but rather teleported there in an instant. The dream ended as I was awoken by the need to use the washroom."
"One night i had a dream that i am back to my home city and everybody is around me, my family , my parents , my sisters and i am enjoying with them, at night they all ask me to sleep as i feel tired, i sleep in dream but at once in dream only i get up and see still my parents and family is with me but i dont open my eyes in my dreams because i feel like this is dream and when i will open my eyes it will break and i dnt want to get apart from my family!!!!!! But i am able to hear my mom , my dad , my sisters voices around me calling me again and again , but i know as soon as i will open my eyes my dream will get break. So actually when i get up next morning i really see myself in edmonton , my roomates around me and else nothing. That was the most lucid dream i had, it was lucid for me as i started crying in morning missing my home badly."
"The most recent dream was about bike riding (which is common activity of mine). So, i was riding my bike with the objective being home, and i was very disturbed because i belived i had been promised to someone. So as i ride home i'm contemplating what is the most reckless thing i can do to get out of this arranged marriage, including suicide. So basically i feel claustorphobic, scared, anxious and infuriated with my parents and their presumption that i'd want an arranged marriage! As i approach my house i get off my bike and push it though the front gate of my yard and i notice that there are sunflowers where there were none before. I'm still very frustrated about my situation but i am really admiring the flowers and i think aloud to myself i should plant these in ""real life"", and at that statement somehting changed about the dream, i was in awe and confused because i was aware of my desire to plant this flower but realized that this wasn't real or my real home."
"i was walking on the sidewalk next to a school yard near my house. on the other side of the fence(inside the school yard) i saw a cute small dog. this terrified me.(which is odd because i'm not afraid of dogs, in fact this dog looked similar to my dog, who i love and do not fear at all). i began to walk faster as the dog came closer. Then, from behind a hill came a small hairy loose skinned creature, he appeared to be walking the dog. he was scarey looking but i was not afraid. this is when i realized it was a dream, i noticed how illogical my fear toward the dog was, especially compared to my lack of fear for this unearthly creature. i thought about where i might be headed in this dream and decided i was probably on the way to my mothers house, i carried on my walk. the dog and the creature did not disapear, they were no longer relevant. i walked away fomr them, and that was that."
"I was in a fairly vacant field and I was trying to find my dads car so I could go home. My parents divorced around 5-6 years ago and have both moved forward with new relationships and I now see my dad around once a week. Everytime I would find his car and get inside, I realized that I was missing body parts. I would be about to climb in and would look down to discover that I was missing my leg and my dad would be gone. After a few attempts to get in the car once I put myself back together, I finally got on my way and realized too late that I was missing my hand. It immediately triggered an intense panic attack and the car began loosing control and rolled. When it was rolling I suddenly realized that I was dreaming and the car stopped rolling and my hand was laying on the dashboard. I reassembled myself and found that I was now at my friends house before I woke up abruptly."
"I am usually really calm in the dream, I am dreaming about a really organized stack of boxes that I put together and through out the dream it truns in to a ripple effect like water on a pond and then back to boxes I have this dream all the time its like the loss of organization freaks me out, in the dream all that is organized suddenly becomes disorganized and I get really angry and start putting things back in order but there is no way for me to get things back to being organized it like the boxes are building up around me I feel trapped with no where to go, this sounds wierd I am sure, but it freaks me out so I force myself to dream of something totally different but I never wake up though and I never think the same change of dream its always different but whatever I do dream about gives me a sense of relief like I am safe or in control again."
"i was dreaming that i was waitressing at my work but there was this one part of my work that was a haunted house. i had one really difficult table, no matter what i did for them they were never happy. they kept asking for hot wings but i did not want to get them hot wings cause they were in the haunted house and i was scared. however, when i tried to explain to them why i couldn't do what they wanted i couldn't talk because there was a bird caught in the back of my throat so it would just come out as bird noises. This was around the time that i realised it was a dream so i was able to pull the bird out of my mouth and speak normally, and then i decided just to ignore that tables requests and not let them bother me because it was just a dream so i figured i wasn't losing out on a tip anyways."
"I was at a hotel (or mall) with my brother because one of my ex bestfriends was having a birthday party there. I recently had my birthday and realized that she had way more presents than I did. I was slightly bothered, but me and my brother decided to leave because my mom was getting remarried the same time and same place, and my brother wasn't too happy. We were going to the parking lot and there were presents everywhere and there were these two girls that were stealing them. My brother and I noticed them first and he just kept walking. It was then that I somehow realized I was dreaming, and I got up the courage to stop them. My brother followed, but he got all the credit and I was angry about this but then someone asked to recall the events of what happened, and he couldn't remember them so I had to describe it. It was then that i woke up."
"most of the time in my dreams i'm running, fighting or hiding from someone,my most recent i dreamed that i had 2 kids and myboyfreind and i were in a foreign country and he was seek and weak and i had to carry the 2 kids on my own and somehow were running to get somewhere and it was hard but all of sudden i knew i was in my room but i don't wake up i sort of watch that knowing that its adream. at times i realize that i'm able to see these scenes as non threatening as if its deja vu, then i realise its not the fist time and not the last time that these would happen then i relax and kind of shift to a different dream which can sometimes relate to my surroundings at that moment like if the tv is on, or my boyfreind sleeping next to me i become aware of his real presence while dreaming."
"It was a dream about my relationship with my significant other. I dreamt that I caught him with another woman, living a different life than the one I knew of. He had a different house with the other woman, and a different job, everything was different. In my dream I followed him to his ""other"" house and seen him holding the other woman in the kitchen. I yelled and got so upset and cried. I realized I was dreaming, and partially awakened, and recognized that I had felt as though I was crying.... But I didn't fully awake, I kind of went back to sleep and kept dreaming the same dream... but it changed... I had drove up to the house my boyfriend and the other woman were in, but didn't go in. Then I dreamt an entire different scene.... I cant remember much of the last scene... but i woke up (fully) shortly after that, and had physically felt like I was crying."
"In the dream, I was been chased, I don’t really remember it is a daytime or a night, and who was/ were chasing me. I did not feel so scary, but I knew I must go hurry. I passed many objects that could help me to hind, and I feel regret every time passing them. I kept running, suddenly I fell from a cliff. I did not know how it happens, and I was so terrified, then I asked myself why it was happen to me. After I told myself it was not real and I was only in a dream. I told myself I could redo this dream, and I could have a better ending. Then, everything went back to the beginning where I was chased; sometime it went back to where I was in a party or talking to someone. The ending always bad, if I feel so upset, I wake up myself. Sometimes, I kept dreaming, until I wake up."
"I was with some friends and I was leaning up against a banister. I was wearing a favorite jean skirt of mine. Everyone was very happy and visting. And one of my male friends that I am very aware has liked me in reality for some time came up behind me. I was not concerned. I was completely calm and at ease, enjoying spending time visiting with my friends. I felt a pain in my vagina and quickly dismissed it. Until it happened again and I realised what my friend was doing. At this point I knew full well it wasn't real and told myself to wake up. I was terrified, sickened, powerless. Unfourtunately I couldn't seem to wake myself. When I finally pulled myself out of the dream I still had the pain from my dream. I was terrified, shaking, almost in tears although I knew it was only a dream. It felt so real."
"I was with some friends at a house. It started of as our normal routine of hanging out. Evenutally (i don't remember all the details in between) we became aware of someone outside whom was trying to get inside. We didn't know who it was, but none of us knew him. The house we had been in developed several different hallways some of which led out side to him or into rooms with no way out. I expirienced anxiety and fear for most of it. And I also remember thinking that it was only a dream and that it wasn't real. However, I could not make anything about it change. I woke up at one point and I remembered the dream and told myself it wasn't real and fell back asleep only to launch right back into where I left off. Usually my dreams are peaceful and happy except for a few like this."
THe most recent was I had watched a suspense movie so iwent to bed a little uneasy- i remember having the dream that i was in bed with my boyfriend (which i really was ) and that someone was downstairs in our house.. SO i was becoming scared for awhile.. but i couldnt speak or anything in the dream iwas just laying in bed.. then i had the sudden realization that i was jsut having a night terror ( this was the first hour of sleep or so) then i awoke in my dream (but really i just thought i was awake i was still asleep and dreaming) but my mind thought i was awake and this was still going on for real.. that there was actually someone downstairs.. then after awhile which seemed 10 minutes or so of being really scared i ACTUALLY woke up and felt a lot of relief nothing was wrong anymore...
"In my dream I was very ill, I was in the childrens hostpial even though I am 21 and I wouldnt believe them when they told me I had cancer. My whole family was sitting around crying and I still wouldnt believe them and they were showing me all the treatments that I was going to have to go through and i was getting very scared but I still didn't want to believe anyone. All the treatments that i was goign to have to go through were very painful looking and I started to get very scared. All that I wanted to do was run away from everyone. Then the next thing I knew i was a party at one of my friends house and then one of my boy friends offered to drive me home and I started running down the highway scared and I was so afraid that I woke myself up."
I had a dream that i was conversating with my decesed grand father whom I have never met. The dream was very emotional since i have always wanted to meet my grandfather who is very grandly talked about by my family and greatly respected. because i love him so much i tried to let the dream go on even though i knew i was dreaming. I told my self while dreaming that i had to remember this dream so i could tell my father. The dream was very dreamlike and heavenly...i felt very peaceful and tried to ask my grandfather questions i already had the answered to. I felt as if i was meeting my grandfather for the first and last time. it was a sad yet happy moment. Although i was happy that i was meeting my grandfather in the dream i also felt anger knowing it was only a dream.
"It was about a month ago. I was driving the car that I own with my best friend in the passenger seat. For some reason we drove off a cliff and started to fall towards the ground. This is when I realized I was dreaming and took control of the dream. I opened the car door and jumped out, making myself able to fly. I am a fan of superheors and gave myself the powers of Superman, and like he does all the time grabbed the rear of my car and gently brought it to the ground safely. But to my surprise my passenger was not in the car. Suddnely i heard a scream, looked up and saw my friend falling from above towards me. With little time to react he landed on me and that is when i woke up and the dream ended... I assume because i was killed..."
"In my dream I was living in a cabin on the lake with my mom. I went inside the cabin and I went into my room. My mom was sitting at my computer writing an email. When I asked her what she was doing she replied by saying that she was sending my Uncle Walter my email address so that we could keep in touch. It was then that I realized that I was dreaming because I knew that my Uncle had passed away several years ago. I pretty much went through the rest of the dream carefree because I knew I was dreaming. Like for example, the cabin was located in the middle of the forest, yet I knew i was dreaming and couldn't be harmed so I went exploring through the forest by myself. I knew it was a dream and scould wake myself up if I had to."
I had a dream that i was sitting on my patio outside my condo and i had grown dreadlocks (most likely because i just started the process of actually growing dreadlocks) then somebody i didn't know was trying to cut my hair. I believe i had tried hitting them a few times in order to stop them but in my dreams whenever i try to hit people it always seems to have little or no effect. So from fear that my hair would be cut i then ran away from the person out into my parking lot. Also in my dreams whenever i'm trying to run it seems as if i cannot run very well. This stranger easily caught up to me and continued trying to cut my hair. Because i was having no success avoiding this person in my dream i just decided to wake up.
"I remember knowing I was dreaming. I could see myself lying in my bed, on my back with my legs crossed in a weird way. Like a way they would be if I were sitting in a chair ir couch. I cannot really remember the exact details of what was going on in the dream, just that I did not like it and that I wanted to wake myself up to stop the dream. I remember feeling very uncomfortable, maybe even agitated. I remeber trying to wake myself up a couple of times before I actually woke up. When I woke up, I was in the position I saw myself in my dream. I also remember feeling relieved that I was able to wake myself up. I still am unable to recall why I was feeling so uncomfortable and such a strong desire to wake myself up."
"I was running away from a tornado. I ran to get into a humungous house, but the people in the house said they couldn't let me in because they thought I would steal their diamonds. The tornado hit and killed me, and I went to heaven. God was a pimp. You could either go mack hoes with God, or go eat at a wicked smorgasboard. It was all cold cuts. I went to eat the cold cuts, cause I was hungry, and the hoes weren't going anywhere. When I was at the smorgasboard, I thought to myself ""wow, I thought you weren't supposed to be able to die in a dream."" And that's when I realized I was in a dream, and I only had a few moments of time in the dream just eating the best ham cold cuts my imagination would allow before waking up."
"I can only recall one somewhat lucid dream, and the reason I remember it is because when I woke up I remembered that I had a lucid dream and since no others have occurred it stuck in my memory. The dream was probably 7 years ago. The part of the dream that I remember is walking into my house, and going to the kitchen, and on the kitchen floor were many grocery bags of groceries that were just brought into the house, someone else brought them in. I remember seeing my aunt there, she might have been in a nightgown or something, there was some sort of clue to me that it was weird that she was there at that time or situation. I remember looking at her and asking her if i was dreaming and I remember her telling me that I wasn't."
"I was at my elementary school and I had won a prize from a coke machine and i was told by another student to go to the music room and I would get to pick a prize. The teacher told me to choose one but i ended up with 5 bags of little toys and when I went to exit the room I was suddenly outside in the snow. (Not even close to the school anymore.) This is when I realized it was all a dream and (still in my dream) I noticed my grandma driving by and I asked her to drive me back to school. Aware that I was still in my dream I purposely gave correct directions back to the school. Usually in dreams I would end up anywhere, possibly giving made up directions to a new location."
"It was my birthday party, and several people were at home celebrating it for me. Everything around looked colorful; the balloons, candles, cakes, drinks, and ofcourse the gift wrappings. I constantly had my eye on the gift boxes and wished I could dig myself into them as soon as everyone had gone. (At this point, my alarm wakes me up a little. I knew I had to leave for school in an hour, but wanted to stay on bed and continue dreaming. After all, I really wanted to peek into those colorful gift boxes). So I close my eyes again, and continue my dream the way I want it to be. Unwrapping the gift boxes one after the other, and discovering gifts I really longed for; diamonds, dresses, shoes, fragrances - just like the way I would spend a perfect birthday."
"I dreamt I was at work and one of the technologists (superior) came to tell me about these 3 problems with samples I had entered. I let her finish and then when I was trying to tell her the circumstances and how I actually hadn't screwed up at all she turned and began playing an online computer game completely ignoring me. I went to complain to my boss about it I realized I was in a dream, so I went back to the tech and kicked her ass. It was like marvel vs capcom training mode, I was giving it my all and she wasn't fighting back and her health was not depleting. I smashed her in the face with a gimble (metal lunch box object) messing up her face, and practiced different punching techniques. Then I woke up."
"At the point I know I'm dreaming but choose to remain dreaming without waking up, I am able to change conversations I had with people at school so it seems that I am saying the right thing to the person. I can recall one dream where my best friend got really mad at me because of something I said, and later when I knew I was dreaming I went back numerous times to that scene to correct the situation so they would be happy with me. However, it did take a few tries because they would still get mad at me no matter what I said, until finally I was forcing my dream to do what I wanted. I controlled my dream so well I was able to get my friend to laugh at the things I said."
"I have a reaccuring dream, usually once a week, that when im in it I know I am dreaming. It takes place in a grocery store and I am frantically trying to grab as much stuff as I can. Particularily food that does not spoil. It's like I know that some impending doom is about to fall on the earth and this doom almost always involves water. I along with other people that I am with take food that we can survive off of as well as food that I know I will miss when it is not readily avaliable to me anymore. No one pays for the food and I always wake up as we are leaving the grocery store to try and get away from what ever force is coming.I always feel frantic but not scared."
"i was at the store when i went to the room where at the door it was written that ""Staff Only"" and i went in , what i saw was that my two classmates one girl and a boy of the Microeconomics class were having sex with each other and when they saw me they stopped and looked at me while still in the position in which they were . Actually when i was in my dream i realized that it was just a dream and i told them that they continue with whatever they were doing and i myself went in the another room , but already i was sexually aroused by seeing her naked i started to masturbate and when i was awaken by the alarm clock i found that my penis was erectile, it was a sudden high."
"My boyfriend turns 20 next week and I was dreaming that i was throwing him a birthday party. It was like a 20 year old party meets with a 3 year old party. I invited a lot of his friends he hasnt seen since high school and we got drunk and played ""little kid games"" such as pin the tail on the donkey and duck duck goose. There were clowns, balloons, and a big birthday cake. I was able to control my actions during this dream. I was able to go and talk to certain people i wanted to talk to and go get myself a drink or participate in a game. Many aspects are fuzzy of the dream. Although I usually remember at least one dream a night there are always large holes in them"
"I was in my house and I was looking outside and the sky was this really wierd purple color. I rememeber thinking something along the lines of the sky isnt that color. I cant really explain how i knew it was a dream but I could tell it was and I left my house to just walk around (for some reason when I know im dreaming I like to walk around and adventure) everything changed as if I was kind of creating obsticals for myself like out of nowhere lava was there and I had to jump from one rock to another. Things were changing so fast though everything started to blend, I felt like I was about to wake up so I tried to close my eyes tighter...but i woke up right after."
"I am outside with some friends and some aquantences from school. It appears to be some kind of party. There are a couple little huts in the backyard that are decorated with streamers. Everything seems quite dark, I am pretty sure it is night time. All of a sudden there are little snakes everywhere crawling up on my legs. Because I am so scared I run into one of the little huts. Once I am inside, there is a bed and a girl from my class lying on it. At this point, I am aware it is a dream. I am suddenly very attracted to this girl and begin to take her clothes off. We begin to get intimate, being fully aware it is a dream, than suddenly wake up before too much happens."
"I was back in my childhood, maybe between 7 or 8 years old. I was coming downstairs in the very early morning when it was still pitch dark outside. My family was in the basement (mom, dad and older sister), and I could see a dim light glowing from the basement from where I stood on the top of the stairs. My sister comes running up the stairs crying hysterically and telling me my dad is really angry because of something I did. I knew I did not do anything wrong, and at this time was aware I was having a lucid dream. I heard alot of violent noise in the basement and was too afraid to face it even though I was in a lucid dream, so I woke myself up."
A nightmare. in this setting i am in my home town which is barren and quite devoid of any thing save ruble. the surronding is dark but bright enough that i can see with out any sources of light. in the dream i am alone but i dont seem to be distraught about this. Its at this point when i realize its a dream and to sound wierd have fun with it. I decide to look around for survivors and and base my self as some kind of hero. the dream works like a movie from that point. I go along with it till i want to change something then i go back and re-do it. it feels like i am day dreaming but its at night and im asleep.
"I was in a bamboo forest exploring with friends when i noticed i couldn't remember how i got there and realized it was a dream. So i started messing with my environment by practicing kung-fu in my dream. I cut some trees down with karate chops, kicked one over, and then decided to pull a crouching tiger hidden dragon sequence by jumping up on the trees and goig from tree to tree with ridiculously larger jumps, all the while having my friends follow. the whole dream was in a third person perspective over myself, with a dull color to it like someone had turn the contrast down on t tv to just above black and white. there was also a grainy texture to the scene.. like an old movie"
"I dreamt i was participating in a family function in a residential hall, sometime in the future. For some reason it appeared the event had stringent restraints on it due to legislation passed by our North American Unified totalitarian government (apparently the government body of all of North America). It became obvious to me i was dreaming when a political activist began protesting at the event. The police burst into room and began arresting the bulk of the group, and was able to envision a doorway out of the room, which led to an unfolding escape route, where i made my way home in a blurry, long drawn out dash through familiar edmonton city streets. The event as i gathered from the streets i traversed, took place downtown."
"I was at someones apartment and I was a police officer. Then all of a sudden, I am looking out the window and the paramedics are taking someone away on the stretcher. I find out that the person is my fiance (even though I do not have a fiance in real life) and he is dead. I start crying and walking off into a field. I feel as though I am in slow motion. I return to all the places that reminded me of him. (this is the point when I realised I was dreaming). So i made time speed up, when I finally get over his death. I now picture myself with a guy I know and I am very happy. Then I woke up."
"I was walking down a bunch of stairs at some sort of house party, apparently looking for my bottle of booze. While walking, I counted my fingers and realized there were 6 on one hand, which I picked up on and became lucid. I tested this theory by pushing my left hand fingers through my right, which you can do in a dream. I then went outside, as I was for some reason still looking for that bottle. Since I knew I was dreaming, I tried reaching out my hand to just make the bottle appear, but I couldnt trick myself into really having the bottle. I tried a few more times, and still could not. shortly after, I wake. -I keep a dream journal... peace"
"in one of my most recent dream i was in a store where the shelves were very close together, i dont remember why i was in that store, but i do remember that i had decided to by a may or a rug. This rug had a rough texture, and it was made up of the colours dark orange and dark red. the edges of the mat were fringed and it looked as if the mat had already been used. I remember then sitting on the mat and it beginning to fly..sometime after this i realized that i control the mat and i knew that i was in a dream, but i could stay in contrl somewhat. it was a very thrilling experience."
"I was driving a very long time on the highway then I pulled over because i had a flat tire. I didn't have a spare tire with me for some reason so i walked over to the nearest house, trying to get some help. However the house was empty, at that moment i realized that i must be dreaming but my dream continued. From there i walked through the house trying to find someone to help me. I walked to the upstairs of the house and my sister was upstairs. I asked her to come help me but she didn't respond to me, like she couldn't hear me. I then was getting really mad and impatient and at that point i woke up."
"I was walking home at night from my friends house. A car drove by me and I seemed to be spooked out so I started running to my house. I ended up going down a back alley and than the car came down the other side of the alley and the man came out to fight or do somethign to me. Instead of finishing the dream I was able to wake myself up by ""screaming at my brain"" and than the dream will disapear. However, I often feel very scared, jumpy, and/or uneasy to go back to sleep after one of these dreams. There are other dreams I have that are friendly though, and wish I did not wake up from."
I was talking with a reporter out side my house about a recent rash of animal attacks. It was pouring rain and yet many of my neighbors were outside talking to one another. Then from down the street a larger bear appeared and began chasing people. At this point i became aware that this was a dream. I still had no control over what was happening yet the bear took no notice of me and preceded to attack several dogs that stood barking at it. It killed the dogs but was unable to catch any of my neighbors or the reporter. i dont recall an ending to the dream but everything was vivid up until the bear killed the dogs.
"It was about the third time I had had the same dream. I was running from a man who was out to kill me. He was armed with a knife and I was being chased through my ""hometown"". I was afraid of this man and in a state of panic until I started to notice there were minor differences between this town and my real town. I also realized I was in a dream and this person couldn't really kill me. At this point, I felt courageosu so I stopped in my tracks, turned towards him and lifted my arms. He stabbed me and I woke up. I felt a slight throbbing in my side where he had stabbed me."
"I am walking through a mall with a huge swimming pool that looks like a lake in the middle. There are different stores and bars around it with people everywhere. Everyone is happy and so am I. I am looking around in the stores at different kinds of make up and clothes. All of sudden people come in and start setting everything on fire and hitting people when they try to run away. For a minute I feel extreme fear and anxiety until I realize in the dream that I am dreaming. Knowing this I'm suddenly not afraid of the people setting fire to the place and hurting everyone, I simply find an escape route (quite easily) and leave."
"I was dreaming that I was trying to get a group of people together, who seemed to be fellow students, in order to go on a ""group quest"" like I might do in an online video game such as World of Warcraft. I realized, within the dream that I was trying to do this and meeting resistance because my fellow students did not play Warcraft. Thereafter I was determined to help them start to play the game so that they could do quests. I set out to Future Shop to get them copies of the game but could not remember how many I needed. I recall driving past MacEwan and admiring the new Health building, whereupon I awoke."
"I used to have a recurring dream where it was dark and I was walking up the back steps to an old small house (the steps were wooden and old) and the step would break ( I felt fear and apprehension) and I would fall through, and fall and fall and then I would have a nightmare. The nightmares were different, but the falling through the step was the same. So eventually, I could recognize it as a dream, and avoid the step that breaks. But then once I was inside the house, the floorboards would break and I would fall anyway, but I would wake myself up before the nightmare started, because I knew it was a dream."
"I was hosting a party with a bunch of friends from my high school, when a group of edmonton oilers came up to me and asked if i wanted to play in a game with them. It was around this time that i became conscious of the fact i was dreaming, but decided to go anyways. I'm a goalie in hockey, and when i played with the pros it was almost like they weren't skilled enough to score on me. Then this rival of mine who i played against in midget jumped in the other net so we could have a shootout which i won 1-0.. i woke up as my team came to celebrate with me."
"Last week I had a dream that my boyfriend was cheating on me with my roommate. I can't remember the details of how I knew, but I remember being at school and being so mad because I somehow knew that he had cheated on me. I was meeting up with him right away and I remember thinking I was going to go up one side of him and down another. When I confronted him, I thought to myself, this can't be happening, this must be a dream, just wake up, just wake up, and I did. I woke up very mad at him, until I really wrapped my mind around the idea that it was a dream."
"Dreamt that I was to meet my boyfriend in Vegas. He was suposed to meet me at the airpot. Didn't come. Get to the hotel. He changed rooms. Found him with another girl. Remember being dizzy from the lights, noise and people. Had to get away from it all. BUt the noise doesnt stop in Vegas. Then realized that it was a dream and that it was not real. Remembered that my boyfriend and I are home and he is asleep next to me. Walking down the strip, trying to remember if what I am seeing is an actual memory of my time in Vegas, or something I was making up in my head."
"Last week, I dreamed that my mother died. Everyone in the dream knew she was dead, but we can still interact with her as if she was alive. I know that while dreaming, that this was just a dream. I cannot recall a lot details anymore since this dream was from the week before. I do remember though, that we (the family) even helped my mother pick out her coffin, and even consulted her about how she wanted her memorial service. It was just weird. Knowing that I was just dreaming, I just played along. Morbid as the dream may sound, it was just a dream and I was aware of it."
I had a dream in which I had moved on with my life with another individual. In my dream the setting was famililar but the new individual was not. When I was aware that I was dreaming...I saw my ex-boyfriend watching me and this new individual walking arcoss the street in front of his car. In the dream my ex-boyfriend called me as I got in the other car and told me to get out of the car. And that is when I woke up. In the dream I felt like I was almost the 3rd person but I felt very sad and confused. I also felt anxious.
"I was with a group of friends in a vehicle. We were driving on a cliff edge over looking a river on which we had to speed past to save someone in the water. We crashed and I fell out of the vehicle, hanging onto the edge of the cliff I realized I was in a dream and was able to bring the river much closer to me so when I let go the fall was not fatal. The dream continued and changed a lot after that point but all the while I was aware it was a dream and somehow it felt more real because of that awareness."
"It was a simple dream. I was somewhere, location wasn't important or clear in the dream, and my dad came in to the area. I was completely aware that he was dead and couldn't be there. I hugged him and started to cry.I told him that he couldn't be here, that he was dead. I knew it was a dream but i didn't let it end. some times when i start to realize i'm dreaming i start to wake up because of it unless i try really hard to stay in it. this was that sort of situation where i made myself stay in this dream."
"My lucid dreams usually occur when I am in a very light sleep. The last one I can recall is in the summer while I was camping. I dreamt I was back in elementary and it was recess and my french immersion class was having a soccer game against the enlgish class. Although in reality I am a horrible soccer player, in the dream I was the star player. I was aware of the fact that I was dreaming, and I seemed to control who I would pass the ball to and who would get into fights and which team would win (mine of course!)"
"I was in a type of love hotel, with theme rooms. My girlfriend was there, and we engaged in various sexual escapades. One room was designed like the inside of an airplane. It was all very colourful and over-the-top. There was a very strange voyeuristic quality to the hotel. At one point, I had to poop in public, which my girlfriend found very amusing. I remember it ending by me having sex with my girlfriend in this strange market-like area. It was strange, because I seemed to recognize that it was a dream, but I had little control over the experience."
"I appeard in the dream at a road crossing and the streets were flooded up to my knees. There were no cars on the street at all, only houses with no other person outside. Then I realized that I was dreaming, right when I realized I was dreaming I felt myself starting to wake up so I sat down in the water. Then I thought this would be much more fun if the water were flowing, so I started travelling down the streets floating on the water. Soon I began to think about how much fun I was having dreaming, then woke up."
"I was waiting for my current boyfriend to pick me up at a hotel I had never been to. I saw an ex-boyfriend walking around the halls of the hotel and I ran to hide in the basement. As I walked down the stairs the walls began to rot. I was looking for places to hide. At some point I realized I was in a dream, so I began running around looking for a way to escape instead of finding a place to hide. I remember calling my boyfriend I was currently with telling him I had to wake up."
"i was in a grave yard and was being chased by this guy i had never seen before. I grab onto this zip line and start zipping down, about halfway down i realize that it is a dream. I tell myself to wake up but i don't. Realizing i am still in the dream i alter my actions so that i am no longer on the zip line and back on the ground. i again tell myself that its only a dream as i see the man running after me. i tell myself to wake up and then i did!"
