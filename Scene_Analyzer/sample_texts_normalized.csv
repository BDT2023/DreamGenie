"I am with the family in a picnic of some sort. There is a snake somewhere visible. I am aware of it, but not concern. Then comes another one - near, but not near enough to alarm. Saniee goes to kill them. He has a cane, but so short like a foot or so. A dance starts with Saniee using the cane to hit the snake and snake is moving around. The second snake is beautiful and each time goes on some pebbles, there are these radiating rainbow colors like jewels. Next thing the snake is shattered in rock size pieces, more like a broken statue than a living thing. Throughout, the mood is happiness and joy"
"I am having lunch with Chris in DC and then I am driving back. As I am driving, I feel that I cannot control the car. Then I realize that Charis and I are sitting in the back seat. Right before we get to the highway, I stop and get behind the wheel. Then I realize that I have left my notebook behind and I was logged in. I get very concerned, but I do not have time to go back to the restaurant. I am thinking that I should have changed the setting on my notebook."
"I am with bunch of my old partners. The mood is up and we are having a good time. We own an orchard together and a bird is talking and hurting the business. I do not see the bird or think about it much, but I am aware of it. We joke that the talking bird could have an accident. We all laugh."
"I am in my old house, but I am not a child. I am searching for something and I'm afraid that I may get caught. I am not supposed to be here. It's middle of the night now and dark. I am about to leave, but I realize someone is there. I go back to the house and I wake up."
"So, I remember being in my mom's house and next thing I know I am walking her dog. This very friendly dog places my hand under ""his"" arm pit pretty much the way my husband does at night in bed while trying to fall asleep. 
Such a good feeling to be home and see my brother and mom. We went to the street market where they sell rotisserie chicken on Sundays and brought some home for lunch. A kid not related to use was playing around in a car the size of a shoe box and went towards the charcoal where they were barbecuing. Don't know if because of my husband or the dog, my hand felt good tucked in."
"Snakes were chasing me from everywhere but not really bitting or charging, just chasing. How annoying!"
"This is the second time in weeks that I dream of war. Not the ""typical"" war ...
I am again in my mom's house -city- and there is all this preparation going on  and i suddenly find out that a war is about to break out. THere are foreign soldiers and lots of guns around. We don't know the language but sounds like Arabic and my kids are trying to send a text message to my husband to ask for help without being caught ... 
aaagghhh.... don't like wars!! not even in my dreams."
"What the ... not me! no, no!! 
Two nights ago I dreamt that I had very very hairy disgusting legs. Ahhgh! This hairy guy I saw on American Idle was there too. He's a bushy red head; he was showing his legs off and then i saw mine. Very similar to his! Why me!? What could that mean?  
Gillet here I come!"
"I am at Shawn's house. There is a party, but I do not remember much. There is a karaoke machine. Everyone is in the other room to eat, I guess. We are going to join them. There is song in German for a few second, but switches to a very soothing Japanese."
"I am making out in the supply room in a high school, but I am not me. I am just someone else going to school. I do not know who I am with."
So I dreamt that I had come to my sister's house and brought a certain VIP to visit and for dinner. We had a very simple dinner and had wine sitting on an couch!
"Wow...  I was going down on this escalator and along the side are these plastic squares rolling along and water too. Then, later,  I learned they were filters ... 
This church was so big, so scary huge that an entire mardi gras parade was going on inside while they celebrated mass in perfect peace ... then another war ...  and yet, in another dream this clerk came to collect a bill which I had already paid. He acknowledged the payment but still had to collect again. He had with him all these graded papers from my kids' school. I looked thru the papers and saw the teachers and students' names but did not see my son's. Where is my happy ending??"
"Now hornets are chasing me! actually just one big brown hornet. It buzzes around me and finally stings me in several places before I am able to catch it and kill it with my own hands. 
How awful!"
"I am walking through this automatic door, which is something between an industrial warehouse door and a pharmacy screen. I turn around to help Soraya's father to step in. But before he does, the door starts coming down. He stops and the door closes. There is an opening under the door, we check it to find out if he can slip through. But the opening closes too. Now we are totally separated. The workers inside busy doing their own thing. I do not seem to worry about him, but I am just upset about what has happened. I ask the workers to help. Apparently it is not as simple to open the door after it gets closed for some security reasons. One of them is on a ladder playing with the control box....."
"So we were in this very nice and warm place. i think I know where. We had this large and very modern house, tropically bright and beautiful. My family and a long lost friend were there. I did not know how long we were staying so did not pack enough for the stay. We went out shopping so we could go dancing and site seeing later. It was so relaxing and fun filled. So warm and bright and fluid.  Just like a dream ..."
"I am reading this email from an old partner asking me if I can help him file the gain from the sale of his stocks. The gain is $382.00. I am thinking that it is interesting that he holds the same stocks as I do. At the same time, we are no longer that close and we do not share files, password, etc. So I am going to write him an email explaining that. But before I write him, I get another email from him saying that he has realized that I do not have what's needed and that he has taken care of it."
