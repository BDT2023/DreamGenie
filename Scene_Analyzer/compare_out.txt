I am with the family in a picnic of some sort. There is a snake somewhere visible. I am aware of it, but not concern. Then comes another one - near, but not near enough to alarm. Saniee goes to kill them. He has a cane, but so short like a foot or so. A dance starts with Saniee using the cane to hit the snake and snake is moving around. The second snake is beautiful and each time goes on some pebbles, there are these radiating rainbow colors like jewels. Next thing the snake is shattered in rock size pieces, more like a broken statue than a living thing. Throughout, the mood is happiness and joy#Output:
