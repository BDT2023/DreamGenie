"I am with the family in a picnic of some sort. There is a snake somewhere visible. I am aware of it, but not concern. Then comes another one - near, but not near enough to alarm. Saniee goes to kill them. He has a cane, but so short like a foot or so. A dance starts with Saniee using the cane to hit the snake and snake is moving around. The second snake is beautiful and each time goes on some pebbles, there are these radiating rainbow colors like jewels. Next thing the snake is shattered in rock size pieces, more like a broken statue than a living thing. Throughout, the mood is happiness and joy"
"I am having lunch with Chris in DC and then I am driving back. As I am driving, I feel that I cannot control the car. Then I realize that Charis and I are sitting in the back seat. Right before we get to the highway, I stop and get behind the wheel. Then I realize that I have left my notebook behind and I was logged in. I get very concerned, but I do not have time to go back to the restaurant. I am thinking that I should have changed the setting on my notebook."
"I am with bunch of my old partners. The mood is up and we are having a good time. We own an orchard together and a bird is talking and hurting the business. I do not see the bird or think about it much, but I am aware of it. We joke that the talking bird could have an accident. We all laugh."
"I am in my old house, but I am not a child. I am searching for something and I'm afraid that I may get caught. I am not supposed to be here. It's middle of the night now and dark. I am about to leave, but I realize someone is there. I go back to the house and I wake up."
"So, I remember being in my mom's house and next thing I know I am walking her dog. This very friendly dog places my hand under ""his"" arm pit pretty much the way my husband does at night in bed while trying to fall asleep. 
Such a good feeling to be home and see my brother and mom. We went to the street market where they sell rotisserie chicken on Sundays and brought some home for lunch. A kid not related to use was playing around in a car the size of a shoe box and went towards the charcoal where they were barbecuing. Don't know if because of my husband or the dog, my hand felt good tucked in."
"Snakes were chasing me from everywhere but not really bitting or charging, just chasing. How annoying!"
"This is the second time in weeks that I dream of war. Not the ""typical"" war ...
I am again in my mom's house -city- and there is all this preparation going on  and i suddenly find out that a war is about to break out. THere are foreign soldiers and lots of guns around. We don't know the language but sounds like Arabic and my kids are trying to send a text message to my husband to ask for help without being caught ... 
aaagghhh.... don't like wars!! not even in my dreams."
"What the ... not me! no, no!! 
Two nights ago I dreamt that I had very very hairy disgusting legs. Ahhgh! This hairy guy I saw on American Idle was there too. He's a bushy red head; he was showing his legs off and then i saw mine. Very similar to his! Why me!? What could that mean?  
Gillet here I come!"
"I am at Shawn's house. There is a party, but I do not remember much. There is a karaoke machine. Everyone is in the other room to eat, I guess. We are going to join them. There is song in German for a few second, but switches to a very soothing Japanese."
"I am making out in the supply room in a high school, but I am not me. I am just someone else going to school. I do not know who I am with."
So I dreamt that I had come to my sister's house and brought a certain VIP to visit and for dinner. We had a very simple dinner and had wine sitting on an couch!
"Wow...  I was going down on this escalator and along the side are these plastic squares rolling along and water too. Then, later,  I learned they were filters ... 
This church was so big, so scary huge that an entire mardi gras parade was going on inside while they celebrated mass in perfect peace ... then another war ...  and yet, in another dream this clerk came to collect a bill which I had already paid. He acknowledged the payment but still had to collect again. He had with him all these graded papers from my kids' school. I looked thru the papers and saw the teachers and students' names but did not see my son's. Where is my happy ending??"
"Now hornets are chasing me! actually just one big brown hornet. It buzzes around me and finally stings me in several places before I am able to catch it and kill it with my own hands. 
How awful!"
"I'm alone ""apparently"" in a room were one of the walls is a large industrial elevator with accordion fenced doors closing from right to left.
The elevator is sent down as a kind of experiment to see if it will bring back something from very deep below.
Kind of like in the movie Hell-Boy in the starting scene.
The first two times it came up with only hints of spiritual beings with no negative connotations actually more funny / witty / spirits than anything else,, although there was no visual entity at all.
the third time it was sent down with much hesitation... on the way up ,, just before it reached the suppericie i head the voice of my father calling my name numerous times as a warning loaded with worries,, like warning me from what was coming up.
My father was not there! he was thousands of miles away.. but he was warning me.... very loudly...
When the elevator reached there was a small person in it behind the fence. it looked like D it was in a 2 piece pajamas with the long curly hair held in a loose pony tail..
I was very very scared,, and tried immediately to press the button to send it back down, but realized only then of a huge mistake! the white oversize button to send it down in case of emergency was actually inside the elevator on the left wall @!!! 
I had to nervously open the gate to try to reach the button ..
was extremely scared and woke up.... immediately with the dream very present for many days."
"I am walking through this automatic door, which is something between an industrial warehouse door and a pharmacy screen. I turn around to help Soraya's father to step in. But before he does, the door starts coming down. He stops and the door closes. There is an opening under the door, we check it to find out if he can slip through. But the opening closes too. Now we are totally separated. The workers inside busy doing their own thing. I do not seem to worry about him, but I am just upset about what has happened. I ask the workers to help. Apparently it is not as simple to open the door after it gets closed for some security reasons. One of them is on a ladder playing with the control box....."
"All I remember was that I was at my mom's house and a war or coup broke out. Don't know who was behind it or was the leading cause or force, but it was happening. We had to escape to the ferry, where apparently we'd be safe; maybe by crossing the ocean out of the country or maybe out of the city where it was happening. My mom, however,  had to feed her birds, many of them; I had to find something to wear that would be warm enough for whatever weather I was about to face. I had to help mom feed the birds too. She'd not leave without making sure they had enough to eat while we were gone. All these small feeding containers had to be filled with bird food while a war was at hand.Water too. In the meantime I kept repeating and asking my college friend, Any, to make sure she would do whatever it took to find me after the war was over. And somehow I managed to become an explosive specialist and set up highly technical and sophisticated booby traps for the ""soldiers"", ""warriors"" or whomever was declaring war at us. It was me, my mom, my friend and the birdsâ€¦"
"the dream came to life as a group of people getting into a different place, I don't know if on this planet or somewhere else.
One aspect that I have the impression to recognize is that we were on a beach were I spend many summers in my youth. It was not exactly the same beach but I know that it was the idea / soul of it.
We were swimming to a buoy looking to body surf the waves back to the beach.
I cough a wave and rode it a surprisingly long time, well over a minute and it was way to easy and very exciting as well as a beautiful experience. The wave reached the beach and was actually monumental when it got there. I dismounted the wave on top of the highest point of the beach like if I was getting of a horse..
The general scene, colors , light , sky were not as any that i know in our regular life on this earth.. this is why the impression of being somewhere else.
There is no bright sunlight, there is like a grayish, brownish tone to the light and nature.. The Sea was not clear blue either.
Then we went on the rocks on the right side of the beach so has to get back into the water, but realized that further out like 200 meters away large breaking waves  were slowing down radically and even not moving or extremely slowly. This was very very odd... It caught all our attention.. The waves were standing or moving millimeters they were definitively not frozen, and they were getting bigger...
I had doubts if this phenomenon was controlled by one of us or by myself. 
After a while we realized that the front standing wave seemed so large because the sea had receded in front of it, we did not see the bottom from were we were, but it became clear that something was going on between the beach and the first tall standing breaker. 
We walked down the rocks and ended on the floor of the ocean walking down towards the Huge Wave but downhill like getting under the Wave and at the same time getting into an underground world with tunnels and some kind of structures. After a while we reached a platform were there was a monorail train of cylindrical form of one compartment with the two ends of pointy needle shape. The monorail moved away from the platform towards the right, it was riding on a structure standing on stills, I did not see the bottom of this huge cave from were they stills came. The rail was doing a large elliptical semi circle.. we were in a huge cave / dome underground. The train got to another platform and somehow I understood that this was the exit from this place or planet. 
Somehow we got back to the original 1st platform and were walking back up within the underground tunnels towards the base of the standing breaking wave when suddenly I ran back towards the platform... I just managed to reach the train before he had left.. I spoke with the driver or ticket person and asked if this was the train / way out of this ""place"". He confirmed. I asked if the train had any schedule or cadence that we should be aware of. He also confirmed but I do not remember if it was hourly or once a day. 
After that I felt more at ease and woke up."
"So we were in this very nice and warm place. i think I know where. We had this large and very modern house, tropically bright and beautiful. My family and a long lost friend were there. I did not know how long we were staying so did not pack enough for the stay. We went out shopping so we could go dancing and site seeing later. It was so relaxing and fun filled. So warm and bright and fluid.  Just like a dream ..."
"The dream started within a convoy on mountain ridges in a landscape similar to the ones seen in pictures of the Great Wall. All the mountains ranges were covered with forests. This must have taken place at the turn of the last century. The convoy stopped and some of the team were looking downhill to a compound of small shacks 2 or 3 units with a larger one in the middle, very white and with a rectangular prism form. the compound was aprox. 5miles further down from our position. Back in the convoy they prepared a kind of humve with a large rocket battery on top of it..One of these cubic frames with rows and rows of rockets. I did not understand what they were doing and why.. The convoy was also getting ready to establish the camp for the night at this same spot so I thought that maybe it was just normal procedure for security. That same evening the Battery started to fire rockets at the compound, tens of rockets. I did not see the reasons for these actions.. Some of the heads of our convoy and myself were looking thought Long-glasses at the houses being hit. Somehow I realized then that I was part of the Leadership structure of this convoy and the actions happening were managed further down the command chain. The next morning the convoy packed and was starting to move further upwards on the mountain ridge... Some persons mentioned to me that they had estimated the structures of the buildings being to strong and/ or to many and that it was better to destroy them / fire at them. I still did not get it.. and thought for me that they should at least have sent some scouts to investigate the area before simply unleashing the rockets. I was staying behind on the campground like for a last control before getting back to the convoy, when I suddenly realized that something was moving very very fast within the forest coming from the compound toward me within the forest.. At the same moment I realized that like 500 yards down from the ridge my kids were playing in the forest.. At this point I was getting very worry and emphasized to the kids to hurry up and how come they were playing there away from the convoy without nobody knowing etc.... At that moment I started to doubt if what was coming from the compound was so fast that it could actually reach the kids before they were on the mountain ridge.!! I rushed downhill to cut off whatever was coming up within the forest. the forest was made of eucalyptus and bamboos in a very open configuration, lots of shade from the sun. I managed to intercept what ever was incoming. There were 3 persons; a leader, strong around 6.3, a huge person very very strong aprox. 7 feet tall and a 3rd. one that I somehow I could not fully see but was very hold and skinny. All of them had the typical round Chinese straw hat lots of old fabrics on them in earthly brown and green colors. The situation was very tense! the leader had a long sword the tall guy some long sticks,, I also had a long sword and a Knife but did not have a clue what to do. As if I had just moved in into that body, still trying to understand the whole situation since the dream started. They made some moves as to go after the kids. Swords were disengaged but I realized that I was not controlling the trade of swordsmanship adequately and the leader was also somehow surprised, all was happening now very very fast.. they moved again towards the ridge, I jumped on the back of the leader and hold on to him like with a Judo or Wrestling hold.. We were somehow flying within the forest barely touching the ground the leader tiptoeing.. I guess I was on top of him due to the fact that i did not know how to keep the combat at distance with the long swords.. I pulled the knife and was very precisely stabbing my enemy between the ribs trying to find the art.. I must have stabbed him 5 to 7 times changing ribs etc with plenty of time.. They guy was not losing any strength and was apparently not getting hurt. I finally cut his throat. We fell down to the ground from apparently 3 Meter were we were hovering fighting. At that point I knew the kids were safe with the convoy. I also realized that I was actually the boss of the convoy or some sort of head samurai.. I was not sure if the guy would stay down for good or if my instinct was right,.... 20 seconds from landing face down, he was starting to move my instinct was right ..I realized also that there was some sort of war rules, duel rules,,that If I was engaged with one opponent the others could not help him,, but now that I was standing the 3 would come after me, so I decided to run. I was running within the forest not going up-hill or down-hill ... the running was getting faster and faster and I started by reflex to use obstacles like boulders / trees anything to jump and get faster and somehow get more energy and different kind of dynamics. At that point we were barely touching the ground, again tiptoeing the ground, sporadic sprints and very long jumps quasi flying.. The 3 guys were gaining ground and their boss was now just behind me , he was clearly the most advanced fighter / warrior.. In front I saw a small village with a few barracks within the forest shade, somehow I understood that the trick was to imagine and foresee the most options available so as to use the obstacles or any hurdles in a sequence that would multiply the energy of the kinetic movements.. I saw a ramp and a roof top that I rushed to and jumped from one to the other getting an amazing speed and finally jumping far up in the air above the trees and leaving the forest. I sensed that the Head of the 3 guys got disconcerted by that last movement and lost ground, he was still behind but did not get the same launch speed. I found myself within an air current.. like the Jet Stream or Gulf Stream in the ocean, and I was riding the current.. I started to make some kind of breaststrokes and mermaid movements to keep the speed and travel faster than the actual current. The current was expressed also visually with some kind of strings starting way way above me and going way way below.. (like if I was flying at 10K feet in the rain.. not knowing were the drops started nor were they were heading) the stings had shapes attached to or in them. They had the same consistence like Lego Blocks but rounded with no hedges with Blue, Black and Red colors. By know I was very calm.. The others were out of sight. I exited the current very close to a mountain ridge that was very high and still withing the altitude that has forests. It was night by now, probably by 11PM. There was some kind of Saloon / Motel on the highest point of that ridge, I flew there knowing that there was somebody waiting for me there. The building was a wood structure with natural gas lights and candles. Old and run down.. few persons I was double checking if any of the 3 guys was there.. All was clear. At a large Window I met the person waiting for me , we obviously know each other and there was a very strong affinity, she was beautiful, after a while we went to her room and spend some very nice time in very decent above belt line foreplay and tenderness, after a while we went to the bathroom were she was starting to undress with very slow movements and in a kind of ceremonial attitude.. all these events were extremely agreeable.. when she was close to being naked she turned around and somehow I was not the the bathroom anymore!!!! She was looking for me as if I would have hid playing a trick.. and soon she realized that I had actually left.. I myself was not understanding how on hearth I could not be there !!!! How stupid could I be.. or the person that was me....!!?? She was very very sad.. and I was starting to get touched by how she was sad. At that moment I flew into the bathroom through the window with a large bouquet of long wild roses.. She and Me (actual me) were very relieved. We moved back to the bedroom and on the way to the bed checked if anything had changed within the Saloon,, all was o.k. I guessed that the time would have been 1am. I knew this lady for a long time,, the passion was deep.. she was somehow my lover / concubine and Wife... I started to have very very clear views of parts of her body, color, skin, droplets of water on her skin , extremely in focus,, kind of HD TV. I was just kissing and liking her most amazing body / skin.. I don't know why at that moment I felt like checking again the Saloon,, she stood up also and accompanied me to the door. Something was different there was less light, I know that It was also much later but there was something.. I approached a wall were there was a long bench and somehow felt that one of the guys apparently sleeping sitting on the bench with the back against the wall with its head down under the chines straw hat was actually the Old Person from the 3 Guys. Somehow I found myself outside the Saloon on the Ridge facing the 3 guys again I dont know if they challenged me to get out for a fight or if I moved out so has to not compromise the person I was with. I was very curious to know how they had found me.. it turned out that the huge guy had some kind of power smell had was some kind of tracker. I was trying to bring to the foreground that It could have been a mistake the firing on the compound and was trying to defuse the situation but it became clear that the whole situation was about something that they wanted!! it was an object that they thought I or the convoy had.. I did not know what it was.. but also realized that they knew that I or the convoy would never give it to them. Nothing happened there. I got back to the room very much looking forward to continue but was surprised to find the door open and the girl gone. My first reflex was that she got tired of waiting ""again"" or that she thought that I was in some kind of business meeting that could not wait and so on.. I was very down but also understanding her feelings. Somehow my instinct rang again and I understood that they had taken her... that the only way to get the object they were seeking was to take from me what was dear to me.. and that this is why they were actually going for my kids earlier in the dream and also why my meetings with my Lover / Wife were so secret and sil"
"I am reading this email from an old partner asking me if I can help him file the gain from the sale of his stocks. The gain is $382.00. I am thinking that it is interesting that he holds the same stocks as I do. At the same time, we are no longer that close and we do not share files, password, etc. So I am going to write him an email explaining that. But before I write him, I get another email from him saying that he has realized that I do not have what's needed and that he has taken care of it."
"I am with the family in a picnic of some sort. There is a snake somewhere visible. I am aware of it, but not concern. Then comes another one - near, but not near enough to alarm.
