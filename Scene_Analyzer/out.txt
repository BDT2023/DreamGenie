My dream last night started in a cold stark landscape at twilight. I was just standing there.
I like twilight. I was feeling rather calmed by it. Around the corner comes a wolf.
I just watched it doing its loping thing - it wasn't running, it wasn't walking - it was just doing its brisk lope. It was panting.
I was standing there admiring it. Then it went around another corner and was gone.
I didn't follow it. But I feel like it actually led to something, though I can't remember the rest of the dream.

Scene 1: A person stands in a cold stark landscape at twilight.
Scene 2: A wolf starts loping around the person, panting. 
Scene 3: The person watches the wolf around them admiringly.    I am in my old house, but I am not a child. I am searching for something and I'm afraid that I may get caught. I am not supposed to be here. It's middle of the night now and dark. I am about to leave, but I realize someone is there. I go back to the house and I wake up.Output:
