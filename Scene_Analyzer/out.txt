My dream last night started in a cold stark landscape at twilight. I was just standing there.
I like twilight. I was feeling rather calmed by it. Around the corner comes a wolf.
I just watched it doing its loping thing - it wasn't running, it wasn't walking - it was just doing its brisk lope. It was panting.
I was standing there admiring it. Then it went around another corner and was gone.
I didn't follow it. But I feel like it actually led to something, though I can't remember the rest of the dream.

My dream setting is in a classroom, like a yoga studio.
The floors are wood, there's lots of mats laying down, the walls are a warm buttery yellow and the lighting is soft.
It looks like a typical yoga studio. I'm on my mat and I'm working something out of my body.
All the postures that I normally do, I'm trying them sideways and upside down and backwards.
I'm amazed that this approach is actually working and it doesn't feel strenuous on my body 
and I wonder why I never thought about doing it this way before.

Such a good feeling to be home and see my brother and mom. We went to the street market where they sell rotisserie chicken on Sundays and brought some home for lunch. A kid not related to use was playing around in a car the size of a shoe box and went towards the charcoal where they were barbecuing. Don't know if because of my husband or the dog, my hand felt good tucked in.Output:

    In my dream, my 7/8th grade students are to be heading out on a field trip. I am standing in the parking lot waiting for the drivers to file out. Donald Trump has his driver-side door open standing between it and the car gesticulating to the bystanders. I want him to get in the car and drive my students to the destination. However, I cannot bring myself to say the words, "President Trump" in order to get his attention and tell him to get in the car and drive it. Instead, I call out, "The car needs to be moving; we need to get to our destination." Nothing happens. Trump keeps talking and waving his hands and is standing wedged between the open black car door. I try again. I yell out, "Get in the car and get it moving; the students need to get to their field trip." He doesn't stop talking. I turn to someone standing next to me and I ask them, "Could you walk over to him and tell him he needs to drive the car - I can't get his attention, and I just can't bear to call out the name 'President Trump.'" I woke up and my dream was so real I am still bothered by it.Output:

    It was my birthday party, and several people were at home celebrating it for me. Everything around looked colorful; the balloons, candles, cakes, drinks, and ofcourse the gift wrappings. I constantly had my eye on the gift boxes and wished I could dig myself into them as soon as everyone had gone. (At this point, my alarm wakes me up a little. I knew I had to leave for school in an hour, but wanted to stay on bed and continue dreaming. After all, I really wanted to peek into those colorful gift boxes). So I close my eyes again, and continue my dream the way I want it to be. Unwrapping the gift boxes one after the other, and discovering gifts I really longed for; diamonds, dresses, shoes, fragrances - just like the way I would spend a perfect birthday.Output:
