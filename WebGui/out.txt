The dream scene was filled with a thick blanket of fog, creating an eerie atmosphere. Two cats, one black and one white, were crouched in the middle of a dense forest, their fur bristling and their tails swishing as they faced off against each other. The trees around them were dark and looming, and the only sound was the occasional rustle of the leaves as the cats circled each other, ready to pounce.
